The solid rubber has less deflection than a stock mount, so no wasted engine motion. Less wasted motion gives you more torque to the wheels (it's not spent twisting the engine) and better engine response."

It's no wonder that these mounts have found their way into the top BMW racers in the country. We originally developed these mounts for E36 and E46 World Challenge racing but they also work perfect in BMW Modified and SCCA club racing and SpecE46 (SE46). These are machined from solid aluminum and have zero deflection. The engine torque will cause a rubber or urethane mount to flex or deflect. The stiffer the material the less movement there is and the more torque is passed through the driveline (instead of being wasted winding up the mount). At the transmission end the flex-free solid mounts will give smoother, crisper shifts since the transmission is no longer dancing on the pliable mount. This puts the shift linkages in better consistent alignment. And unlike rubber or urethane the aluminum has zero wear and is not affected by leaking oil or other fluids so this is likely the last set of motor and transmission mounts you will ever need. We have designed these mounts so the engine is 5mm lower and the transmission is 1mm lower than the factory mounts. This helps lower the center of gravity for better balance and handling. We very strongly recommend using the transmission and engine mounts together as a complete kit. Mixing a rubber mount with a metal mount will cause undue stress on the mouting points and will lead to a failure. We never advise using a solid mount unless a corresponding solid mount is also used. This kit fits the E36, E46, Z3, and Z4 6 cylinder models listed below, including M3 models.   These are a no-compromise design for all-out racing use. Full solid aluminum mounts should not be used on street-driven cars. Because there is no material to absorb vibration these will be quite harsh for regular street use (track cars don't care about noise).     are very strongly recommended to go along with these solid motor mounts to reduce the risk of damage to the subframe. The motor mount section of the subframe should be reinforced to prevent stress and failure of the subframe.     1992-1999    323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3  1999-2006    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 328i 328ci 330i 330ci M3  2001-2006    330i 330ci  1997-2002    Z3 2.3 Z3 2.5i Z3 2.8 Z3 3.0i M Roadster M Coupe  2003-2005    Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i  2006-2008    Z4 M Roadster M Coupe"

It's no wonder that these mounts have found their way into the top BMW racers in the country. These are machined from solid aluminum and have zero deflection, engine torque will cause a rubber or urethane mount to flex or deflect allowing more torque to passed through the drive line (instead of being wasted winding up the mount). When paired with our flex-free solid transmission mounts you'll get smoother, crisper shifts since the transmission is no longer dancing on the pliable mount. This puts the shift linkages in better consistent alignment. And unlike rubber or urethane the aluminum has zero wear and is not affected by leaking oil or other fluids so this is likely the last set of motor and transmission mounts you will ever need. We very strongly recommend using the solid transmission and engine mounts together as a complete kit, mixing a rubber mount with a metal mount will cause undue stress on the mounting points and will lead to a failure. We never advise using a solid engine mount unless a corresponding solid transmission mount is also used.These are a no-compromise design for all-out racing use, full solid aluminum mounts should not be used on street-driven cars since there is no material to absorb vibration making these quite harsh for regular street use (track cars don't care about noise)."

They use the OEM motor mount bolt holes on the E30 subframe. The mounts are angled with offset bolts to position the engine so that proper drivetrain alignment is maintained. They are used with E36 engine brackets. Revshift motor mounts are made by Revshift in the U.S.A. from high-quality polyurethane. Revshift mounts are the most durable and reliable mounts on the market. CNC machined billet aluminum flanged ends are embedded deep in the urethane which prevents the isolated ends from separating under extreme loads. Utilizing class 14.9 alloy steel removable screws these mounts will hold your engine in place for a lifetime. To further ensure the strength of these mounts we form the threads with a forming tap which creates denser and stronger threads in the billet aluminum end pieces. These mounts have removable screws for ease of installation. We recommend using Loctite on the threads during installation. Revshift Performance Engineering is a high-performance parts manufacturer with a focus on quality, reliability, and performance. Utilizing high-precision machining technologies and their very own Polyurethane Manufacturing Department, every Revshift product is designed, manufactured, and tested in-house at their Detroit, Michigan facility."

They withstand 1,100 degrees F of radiant heat and up to 450 degrees F of direct heat. The extra protection of the heat sleeves is a perfect fit for street cars, track cars, and other high heat applications. Their mounts withstand temperatures up to 180 degrees F and do not need any heat protection during regular usage, but we recommend the extra protection of their sleeves for all vehicles with high underhood heat temperatures such as turbo and supercharged vehicles. Condor heat sleeves can be easily installed by simply slipping the sleeve around the engine mount and securing using the Velcro tabs. *LISTING IS FOR ONE HEAT SHIELD **Heat sleeve fitment is for Condor Engine Mounts only."

When the factory wanted to upgrade their motor mounts, this was the solution! The stock S14 motor mount is filled with fluid and a relatively soft rubber compound. This was designed to absorb vibration from the high strung S14 engine. But during hard track use the stock motor mounts can become a liability with the engine twisting and shifting around. BMW Motorsport's solution was to design a mount that is not fluid filled and solid rubber. The Group N mounts are 20% stiffer than the stock mounts which makes them perfect for weekend fun cars, autocross, and even light track use. Because it lacks a fluid for dampening, more vibration will make its way into the car. These mounts are the same height as the original stock mounts. Pricey? Maybe. But these are factory Motorsport parts that work as advertised. These motor mounts are widely regarded as among the best on the market for a motor mount upgrade. Combine these with the Group N transmission mounts for a matched set.   When doing any sort of repair or maintenance there is no replacement for genuine factory parts.

Most stock BMW motor mounts are fluid filled and the stiffness of the mount depends on this fluid. But over time the fluid leaks out and the strength of the mount is greatly reduced. A worn motor mount allows the engine to twist and shift around. The harder you're driving the more shift will occur. As the engine is moving around it can contact other parts in the engine bay - usually cooling related. The mechanical fan can hit the radiator; the A/C compressor can hit a radiator hose, the exhaust will flex and may break. Twisting of the engine can also lead to shifting problems as the transmission twists with it. There are countless issues related to worn or compressed motor mounts so don't overlook these as a regular replacement item (every 50,000 miles)."
