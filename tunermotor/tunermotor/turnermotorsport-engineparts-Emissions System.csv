The Turner engineered catch cans offer a pre-setup design based ion desired flow direction, however, this does not limit you to this flow. The inner baffle orientation can be easily adjusted to flow in both directions in case you decide to move this catch can to a different vehicle. A 4 chamber system baffle system inside the catch can was engineered to create multiple changes in the direction of airflow within the separator to cause oil droplets to fall out of suspension before exiting the catch can. Having a closed/recirculated design reduces oil ingestion and promotes cleaner emissions and odor-less operation."

We see crankcase vent issues on even stock engines but with more boost the problems are exponential. This Vargas upgraded PCV valve, and an oil catch can, are what the N54 engine needs and may alleviate most of your oil and boost leak issues. The PCV valve is supposed to let oil either return to the oil pan or pass through the intake manifold and get burned up in the combustion chamber. However, BMW used a weak plastic vent valve that doesn't seal well when under boost. Instead of  closing and venting the oil out of the intake, it's forced through this valve and into the intake and coating your valves with oil residue and carbon. Most boost equals more oil forcing its way by. This upgraded N54 PCV valve uses higher grade materials, including aluminum, to provide a better seal and prevent oil from entering the intake. It's an easy install and a must-have item when considering any turbo work."

What this means is that when the turbochargers are making boost, pressurized air can become forced backwards through the valve and back into the crankcase. Depending on the condition of your PCV valve this can range from irritating to dangerous as a pressurized case can cause all sorts of issues. Additionally, if your valve cover is cracked due to age or has a bad gasket you are more than likely experiencing a pressure leak either internally or externally. These two features can cause even a low-mileage N54 to run like a tired elephant, sometimes even unlocking a special bonus function known as ""Limp Mode"". The solution is to replace any failed components and upgrade the PCV valve to something more capable withstanding the abuse of a turbocharged environment. FTP Motorsport has you covered with this solid aluminum valve assembly. It is essentially the same thing that came in your car from the factory, made out of aluminum. The internal components have also been made to fit tighter and outlast the life of an off the shelf replacement. No, this won't be the very last PCV valve you buy, but it will most certainly alleviate a lot of headaches common to N54 owners. And if you're tuned, big twin or single swapped you need one of these yesterday."

The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance.

We're seeing a lot more 135 and 335 cars with drivability and performance issues because oil has sneaked by the ring seals and is coating the intake piping, intercooler, intake valves, and other critical areas. The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance.

Make sure your BMW engine performs as it should, and doesn't use more fuel than it needs to, by simply changing your oxygen sensor today. There is no lifespan on O2 sensors but there are several fault codes that indicate a failed sensor (O2 monitoring, cat efficiency, O2 heating circuit, O2 readiness, and others). The O2 sensor is heated and has a self-calibration feature so once you get the codes or feel performance has suffered, a new sensor is a good starting point to get you back to peak performance.

The intent behind this design was to offer the most effective oil/air separation while being incredibly easy to maintain. The included drain kit allows you to route the drain hose to a mounted location near the belly pan of the vehicle making it convenient to empty at oil change intervals. Modern-day emissions regulations require the use of a closed crankcase ventilation (PCV) system to recirculate combustion blow-by gases from the crankcase back into the intake to be burned. Unfortunately, these blow-by gases contain water vapor (which is a byproduct of combustion) and pick up oil mist from and the windage cloud and cam lubrication system as they travel through the crankcase. Due to less than 100% effective air/oil separation in the stock PCV system, some oil mist and water vapor gets carried back to the intake tract and over time causes oil deposits in the intake manifold, intake ports, and on the back of the intake valves. All will eventually lead to poor performance and reduced fuel economy, and the presence of this oil mist in the intake charge may even increase the risk of engine-damaging detonation. With forced induction, track use, and/or extended high RPM usage, these symptoms increase as the factory PCV system is overwhelmed, and a catch can becomes a must for your N20 powered BMW. Features: 6061-T6 billet machined body, anodized black for lasting protection and appearance Strategically positioned 4 chamber baffle system maximizes oil/air separation Knurled and black anodized oil dipstick makes inspecting oil volume of reservoir clean and simple Sealed with a pre-installed o-ring Includes 2.5mm Allen key to remove baffle plates for cleaning Engineered to create multiple changes in the direction of airflow within the separator to cause oil droplets to fall out of suspension before exiting the catch can Closed/recirculated design reduces oil ingestion and promotes cleaner emissions and odor-less operation Valved drainage system - no removal of can necessary to empty"

Our own shop has gone the extra step and offers media blasting of the intake valves to strip away the oily buildup we have seen.Our shop also strongly recommends an oil catch can be installed in the line for the crankcase vent. The oil catch can traps oil as it leaves the valve cover and holds it in a canister. Whatever minimal vapors are left over in the oil is then vented back through the canister and into the intake where it is safe to be burned up in the engine or recirculated back through the system again. This is the way the system was designed! At each oil change simply unscrew the canister and empty the trapped oil with your regular used oil. A dipstick is integrated into the cap so you can monitor the oil level. Installing one of these will avoid costly repairs in the future and help maintain your boost and performance. It's one of the smartest modifications you can make because it demonstrates a well-thought out tuning strategy and care for the condition of your engine.The ECS Oil Catch Can is made from aluminum and with a stealthy black anodized finish. Multiple brackets are available so you're not limited on where to mount it. The location is key as heat will evaporate the oil and send too much vapor back into the engine (where cooler air will turn it back into fluid). The ECS OCC also has a factory-like appearance.Note: Since the crankcase vent system is considered part of the overall emissions system, installing this may be a violation of local, state, and federal laws. While exemptions are made for track/race and off-road use, check with your local state inspection facility on using this in street-driven vehicles."

The Mishimoto BMW N55 catch can kit uses proven engineering from the Mishimoto 2-Port Compact Baffled Oil Catch Can, with its bronze filter and internal baffle, to better separate the oil from the crankcase vapors. The engineers at Mishimoto designed a CNC-machined lid that features large inlet and outlet ports in order to match the inner dimension of the CCV hose. This baffled oil catch can will defend your intercooler, intake system, and VANOS system from oil blow-by and help maintain proper octane levels to reduce potential detonation. The kit comes with two direct-fit hoses, which require no modification to the engine cover, and one direct-fit mounting bracket that not only is extremely easy to install, but also mounts the can in a serviceable location! Two CNC-machined aluminum, 3/4"" barb fittings connect the hoses to the can. And, like every Mishimoto oil catch can, this baffled catch can kit comes with the Mishimoto Lifetime Warranty! Mishimoto's catch cans are different from most air-oil-separator (AOS) systems on a few levels. First, their catch cans are not heated. This means that all of the blow-by is able to condense in the can, including low-octane oil vapors and contaminated fuel vapors. Most AOS systems also drain the blow-by back into the oil pan, while Mishimoto's catch cans trap the blow-by and keep it out of the engine permanently. If you've seen what we've seen in the bottom of most catch cans, you won't want that draining back into your oil either. Features & Specifications: Direct fit for 2011-2013 BMW 335I/335XI/135I Single can mounts in line with the PCV system to separate oil from air using a 50-micron bronze filter Helps reduce carbon buildup on intake valves Patent-pending billet 6061 aluminum can sealed with Viton™ O-rings Installs in under 30 minutes Robust, application-specific bracket mounts the can in a serviceable location Includes pre-molded hoses for simplified installation Defends Vanos system and essential engine components from oil blow-by CNC-machined aluminum barbed fittings ensure a sturdy connection between lines and can Catch can has a 3 oz. capacity for longer servicing intervals Internal air diverter increases air turbulence to improve oil separation Helps maintain proper octane levels to reduce potential detonation Filter and can are fully serviceable Mishimoto Lifetime Warranty"

Under ideal circumstances, the oil vapor would pass back into the intake and get burned up during normal combustion. The liquid oil would follow a path back down into the oil pan and be reused. This system is environmentally friendly but plagued with problems. The heating elements can fail or solid oil and carbon particles can block the oil separator valve. With no escape, the oil will continue to pool and collect in the valve cover or make its way into the combustion chamber leading to excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, idle and running issues. These issues are worse in colder climates where the freezing temperatures create a oil sludge condition that is impossible to clear. Thankfully, the CCV is replaceable on the early N52 engines (2006) and should be inspected during a major service and any time the valve cover is off. Oil can also back up into the throttle body, which is easier to check than the oil separator itself. Later N52 engines do not have a serviceable oil vent as it is integrated into the valve cover and not a separate part.   The oil separator can be replaced on its own but for a complete service we also recommend replacing the oil separator hoses and cleaning the valve cover. Any valve cover or intake manifold work should include a new oil separator valve.     2006-2011    325i 325xi 330i 330xi - Sedan  2006-2012    325xi - Wagon  2006-2007    525i 525xi 530i 530xi  2006-2008    Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si"

The existing stock system does a very poor job of separating fluid and vapor and this leads to an oily film or even small pools of oil throughout the turbos and intake. We're seeing a lot more 135 and 335 cars with drivability and performance issues because oil has sneaked by the ring seals and is coating the intake piping, intercooler, intake valves, and other critical areas. The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance. Our own shop has gone the extra step and offers media blasting of the intake valves to strip away the oily buildup we have seen. We have only seen serious blow-by issues on the N54 engines but that shouldn't stop someone from adding a OCC to an N55 engine as well.   Our shop also strongly recommends an oil catch can be installed in the line for the crankcase vent. The oil catch can traps oil as it leaves the valve cover and holds it in a canister. This catch can is located in a cool spot of the engine bay where the oil will condense easier and stay in the can. Whatever minimal vapors are left over in the oil is then vented back through the canister and into the intake where it is safe to be burned up in the engine or recirculated back through the system again. This is the way the system was designed! At each oil change simply unscrew the canister and empty the trapped oil with your regular used oil. The Burger Tuning oil catch can is the best we have seen so far. Installing one of these will avoid costly repairs in the future and help maintain your boost and performance. It's one of the smartest modifications you can make because it demonstrates a well-thought out tuning strategy and care for the condition of your engine.   The BMS Oil Catch Can is made from aluminum and with a stealthy black anodized finish. It installs on the passenger side of the engine with a dedicated bracket and new oversized vent lines. This gives it a factory-like appearance. Since BMS designed their catch can from scratch they can guarantee it fits and performs correctly for the N54/N55 engine, unlike other catch cans on the market that are poorly retrofitted from other applications and under-sized for the N54/N55 engine.   Note: Since the crankcase vent system is considered part of the overall emissions system, installing this may be a violation of local, state, and federal laws. While exemptions are made for track/race and off-road use, check with your local state inspection facility on using this in street-driven vehicles.     + Increases air intake efficiency  + Promotes engine longevity  + Double-baffled design allows excellent air/oil separation  + Large In/Out ports (no tapered sizes that slow flow)  + Stealth mounting on cooler side of engine bay (promotes condensation of oil to vapor)  + Anodized black lightweight aluminum  + N55 version mounts out of sight under the radiator support  + Made in USA with a lifetime guarantee     2011-2013    BMW 135i  2011-2013    BMW 335i 335xi"

The existing stock system does a very poor job of separating fluid and vapor and this leads to an oily film or even small pools of oil throughout the turbos and intake. We're seeing a lot more 135 and 335 cars with drivability and performance issues because oil has sneaked by the ring seals and is coating the intake piping, intercooler, intake valves, and other critical areas. The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance. Our own shop has gone the extra step and offers media blasting of the intake valves to strip away the oily buildup we have seen.Our shop also strongly recommends an oil catch can be installed in the line for the crankcase vent. The oil catch can traps oil as it leaves the valve cover and holds it in a canister. This catch can is located on the cooler side of the engine where the oil will condense easier and stay in the can. Whatever minimal vapors are left over in the oil is then vented back through the canister and into the intake where it is safe to be burned up in the engine or recirculated back through the system again. This is the way the system was designed! At each oil change simply unscrew the canister and empty the trapped oil with your regular used oil. The Burger Tuning oil catch can is the best we have seen so far. Installing one of these will avoid costly repairs in the future and help maintain your boost and performance. It's one of the smartest modifications you can make because it demonstrates a well-thought out tuning strategy and care for the condition of your engine.The BMS Oil Catch Can is made from aluminum and with a stealthy black anodized finish. It installs on the cooler side of the engine with a dedicated bracket and new oversized vent lines. The location is key as heat will evaporate the oil and send too much vapor back into the engine (where cooler air will turn it back into fluid). The BMS OCC also has a factory-like appearance. Since BMS designed their catch can from scratch they can guarantee it fits and performs correctly for the N54/N55 engine, unlike other catch cans on the market that are poorly retrofitted from other applications and under-sized for the N54 engine.Note: Since the crankcase vent system is considered part of the overall emissions system, installing this may be a violation of local, state, and federal laws. While exemptions are made for track/race and off-road use, check with your local state inspection facility on using this in street-driven vehicles"

The engine computer relies on data from the sensor to make adjustments in engine efficiency and performance. When your BMW oxygen sensor fails, the computer can no longer sense the air/fuel ratio, so it ends up guessing -- resulting in poor performance, poor gas mileage, and increased pollution. Make sure your BMW engine performs as it should, and doesn't use more fuel than it needs to, by simply changing your oxygen sensor today. There is no lifespan on O2 sensors but there are several fault codes that indicate a failed sensor (O2 monitoring, cat efficiency, O2 heating circuit, O2 readiness, and others). The O2 sensor is heated and has a self-calibration feature so once you get the codes or feel performance has suffered, a new sensor is a good starting point to get you back to peak performance. As a leading source of high-performance BMW parts and accessories since 1993, we at Turner Motorsport are honored to be the go-to supplier for tens of thousands of enthusiasts the world over. With over two decades of parts, service, and racing experience under our belt, we provide only quality performance and replacement parts. All of our performance parts are those we would (and do!) install and run on our own cars, as well as replacement parts that are Genuine BMW or from OEM manufacturers. We only offer parts we know you can trust to perform!"

Under ideal circumstances, the oil vapor would pass back into the intake and get burned up during normal combustion. The liquid oil would follow a path back down into the oil pan and be reused. This system is environmentally friendly but plagued with problems. The heating elements can fail or oil and carbon particles can block the oil separator valve. With no escape, the oil will continue to pool and collect in the valve cover or make its way into the combustion chamber leading to excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, idle and running issues. These issues are worse in colder climates where the freezing temperatures create an oil sludge condition that is impossible to clear. The plastic hoses can become brittle and crack which leads to vacuum leaks and oil leaks. Thankfully, the CCV is replaceable on the early N52 engines (2006 and some 2007 models) and should be inspected during a major service and any time the valve cover is off. Oil can also back up into the throttle body, which is easier to check than the oil separator itself. Later N52 engines do not have a serviceable oil vent as it is integrated into the valve cover and not a separate part.   This is a kit containing the oil separator, the vent hoses, and the intake manifold gaskets that are done during a typical oil separator replacement. Complete kit includes:"

The engine computer relies on data from the sensor to make adjustments in engine efficiency and performance. When your BMW oxygen sensor fails, the computer can no longer sense the air/fuel ratio, so it ends up guessing -- resulting in poor performance, poor gas mileage, and increased pollution. Make sure your BMW engine performs as it should, and doesn't use more fuel than it needs to, by simply changing your oxygen sensor today. There is no lifespan on O2 sensors but there are several fault codes that indicate a failed sensor (O2 monitoring, cat efficiency, O2 heating circuit, O2 readiness, and others). The O2 sensor is heated and has a self-calibration feature so once you get the codes or feel performance has suffered, a new sensor is a good starting point to get you back to peak performance."
