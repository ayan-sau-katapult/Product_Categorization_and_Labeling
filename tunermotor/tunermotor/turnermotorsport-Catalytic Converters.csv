Fan of the rasp that comes from the S54 engine? This front exhaust section replaces the single resonator in the US exhaust (or the cats in Euro models) with a straight-through pipe. This can be a direct bolt-on to the stock or Euro headers and includes rear O2 sensor ports (for Euro models, must be plugged for US models). You can use this with the Supersprint resonator delete section 2 pipe for the max rasp effect. Or mount it with any other section 2 exhaust to fine-tune your sound. Supersprint exhaust is widely recognized as the leader in complete exhaust system upgrades - extremely high quality, well designed for optimal flow, and amazing sound. Even at a premium price, Supersprint is an unbeatable exhaust system because every aspect is done to such a high level. A Supersprint exhaust rewards you with a terrific sound, long-lasting construction, and excellent fitment. The Supersprint sound is very 'European' which fits the sporting sophistication of BMWs perfectly. Most systems are also modular - sections can be added or removed to custom tailor the exhaust sound to your preference. Aside from 'Race' systems, their mufflers meet European noise laws so you get a refined and tuned sound without being excessively loud. Supersprint exhausts generally run at a premium over other systems but no other system on the market can match their quality, performance, or reputation!

If you want to hear more of your exhaust note or feel that your Z4 could use more growl and excitement this set of Supersprint front exhaust pipes might do the trick! These pipes eliminate the second set of catalytic converters, which opens up the exhaust and removes a big restriction. The N54 turbos and the main set of cats in the downpipes already muffle the sound. The second set of cats also work as mufflers, dampening the sound even further. These stainless steel pipes bolt to the stock downpipes. Use them with the stock rear muffler section (requires adapters) or with the Supersprint sport mufflers.

Fortunately, Supersprint has the reputation covered when it comes to BMW exhausts. For over 60 years their goal has always been designing and building the highest quality exhaust available. This has been achieved through extensive testing using real race teams to get the best feedback there is to offer, from the ones who demand the best every day. Extensive dyno testing, high-quality materials, and race team feedback are what allow Supersprint to extract the power from your engine, not just the noise. Supersprint sport cats for the V8 are designed to work with their performance headers and replace the stock main cats. The Supersprint sport cats are much freer-flowing than a factory-style cat. With less restriction, less effort is required to move the exhaust gasses which will free up horsepower and torque. This cat section will mount to the Supersprint merge collectors and then to a Supersprint or stock section 2.

Because of the various sizes and shapes of the stock hydro-formed pipes it's not possible to easily mix and match exhaust sections from different manufacturers. Supersprint has solved this by designing their section 1 and 2 together and offering multiple configurations that cover just about all of your needs. With the Supersprint system there are three options for replacing the two sets of restrictive factory cats. For race cars we recommend the straight test pipes with no cats whatsoever. These have the least restriction, optimizing exhaust flow for the best power output. These test pipes are also offered with a set of tuned resonators that alters the tone and gives more rumble to the exhaust note. Lastly, this section is available with a set of HJS metallic sport cats. These cats are freer-flowing than stock, which aids power output, but still cleanse the exhaust gases which helps during emissions inspection. The Supersprint section 2 for the E9X M3 is an x-pipe with or without a resonator. The resonator acts as a pre-muffler and dampens the sound to a lower level. Generally, unless this is a full-blown racecar, you would use a resonator if section 1 is the straight test pipes. If a resonator or cats are being used in section 1 then use the straight pipes in section 2. Otherwise the sound may be too quiet and too much like stock.Supersprint exhaust is widely recognized as the leader in complete exhaust system upgrades - extremely high quality, well designed for optimal flow, and amazing sound.
