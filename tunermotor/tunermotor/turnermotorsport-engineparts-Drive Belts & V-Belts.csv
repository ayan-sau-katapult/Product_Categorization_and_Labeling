When this happens, there is a high chance of the belt getting sucked behind the front damper pulley and then being pushed past the crank seal into your oil pan. From there it can get sucked into the oil pick up causing total engine failure. Even if you do not lose the engine, it is a COSTLY repair to remove the sub-frame and drop the oil pan to remove the belt. The best way to combat this is to watch for oil leaks and keep up on your maintenance. BUT, even with those preventative measures, pre-mature belt failure can occur. This crank seal guard installs over your front crank seal and will keep the belt from being sucked in if a belt failure does occur. At only $69.00, this is a cheap way to ensure you do not end up having to replace your motor from oil starvation due to an ingested belt. Vargas' seal is different from those already on market in two major ways. Firstly, it is not offensively priced. At $69.00 it’s easy on the budget. Secondly, it is 100% billet with no welds on the tabs to break, no cheap bent thin steel pieces. 100% Billet 6061-T6 aluminum, anodized black for long-term corrosion resistance. Crank Seal Guard includes: One VTT Billet N54/55 Crank Seal Guard Two extended 12.9 Grade bolts, and two stainless washers We highly recommend you install WITH a crank bolt capture at the same time, as you have to remove the damper anyway. Then you will get the benefit of helping eliminate the dreaded spun crank hub and the crank seal issue If you order the Crank Seal Guard, and CBC together they are $148 for a $20 savings."

BMW's N54 had a notoriously rocky start with reliability due to multiple issues such as fuel injectors failing, turbos failing, serpentine belt failure, crank hubs coming loose, and more... BMW made multiple attempts to fix the issues plaguing the N54, but they could only do so much and the fixes rolled out seemed temporary at best. Following the N54, BMW released their updated N55 and S55 engines, giving many people hope that these engines would address the previous issues. Unfortunately, this was only some-what the case. Crank hubs and crank bolts continued to loosen over time and serpentine belts continued to shred themselves and get pulled into the oil pan through the front main seal. For all three engines, this meant a single failure could effectively turn your engine into an oversized paperweight. Luckily for us, the BMW community is full of skilled enthusiasts who have gladly taken up the task to offer solutions! The first headache to be addressed was the Crank Hub and Bolt. Using a simple plate that fits perfectly over your crank hub's hex-head bolt and mounts up against the damper, the crank bolt is effectively locked in place, preventing it from being able to back out until the plate is fully removed. Next up was the serpentine belt failures. It's not known what exactly causes the serpentine belt to split, but once it does, the pieces hanging off of the belt wrap around and behind the damper. This leads to the belt breaking up into smaller pieces and eventually getting pushed between the crank hub and rear main seal into the oil pan. These small pieces of debris get caught in and block the oil pickup, preventing oil flow and leading to engine failure. To prevent this, multiple aftermarket companies came up with their own versions of Crank Seal Plates. This plate is installed behind the front damper, blocking the opening that allows the serpentine belt to pass between the crank hub and seal, keeping debris out of your oil pan!

BMW's N54 had a notoriously rocky start with reliability due to multiple issues such as fuel injectors failing, turbos failing, serpentine belt failure, crank hubs coming loose, and more... BMW made multiple attempts to fix the issues plaguing the N54, but they could only do so much and the fixes rolled out seemed temporary at best. Following the N54, BMW released their updated N55 and S55 engines, giving many people hope that these engines would address the previous issues. Unfortunately, this was only some-what the case. Crank hubs and crank bolts continued to loosen over time and serpentine belts continued to shred themselves and get pulled into the oil pan through the front main seal. For all three engines, this meant a single failure could effectively turn your engine into an oversized paperweight. Luckily for us, the BMW community is full of skilled enthusiasts who have gladly taken up the task to offer solutions! The first headache to be addressed was the Crank Hub and Bolt. Using a simple plate that fits perfectly over your crank hub's hex-head bolt and mounts up against the damper, the crank bolt is effectively locked in place, preventing it from being able to back out until the plate is fully removed. Next up was the serpentine belt failures. It's not known what exactly causes the serpentine belt to split, but once it does, the pieces hanging off of the belt wrap around and behind the damper. This leads to the belt breaking up into smaller pieces and eventually getting pushed between the crank hub and rear main seal into the oil pan. These small pieces of debris get caught in and block the oil pickup, preventing oil flow and leading to engine failure. To prevent this, multiple aftermarket companies came up with their own versions of Crank Seal Plates. This plate is installed behind the front damper, blocking the opening that allows the serpentine belt to pass between the crank hub and seal, keeping debris out of your oil pan! Also included in this kit are the components to service your front Oil Cooler/Filter Housing gaskets, refresh your drive belt system, and install the aftermarket upgrades.

We know that controlling the harmonic resonance of the BMW 6 is highly important as RPMs rise, but the ideal configuration of the inline-6 motor makes even experienced engine builders overlook some fundamental principals of engine harmonics that can be destructive. ATI Performance Products has partnered with VAC Motorsports to develop new dampers for BMW 2.5L, 2.8L, 3.0L and 3.2L straight-6 engines found in the E36 and E46 M3, E9X and E6X, as well as newer Z3s and Z4s. These dampers eliminate crankshaft harmonic vibration, which allows the engine to produce more horsepower and torque, while also reducing internal engine wear at the same time. Broken oil pumps and timing chains will be a thing of the past! When used with a VAC accessory pulley, these dampers are a direct replacement over the OEM balancer. They have a 7” outer diameter and include OEM style timing alignment tabs.

Any accessory that spins from the main drive belt is using up power. That's power that could otherwise be used to move the car. By giving some of that power back to the engine, you can make the car faster! It's like   !   Underdrive pulleys for your BMW will slow down engine-mounted accessories - the water pump, power steering pump, and alternator*. These systems contribute to 'parasitic losses' - power lost from what the engine could produce if it did not have these systems. Since less energy is used to move them, that power is transferred back to the engine and used to propel the car. Our pulleys give a 10-20% reduction in rotation, releasing up to 11hp on most BMW six-cylinder engines. There's also a small but noticeable improvement in throttle response too! We have done extensive testing and development work, both on and off the track, to ensure that the accessory systems function as they should. On our Racing pulley kits we actually underdrive certain components more so we feel our Street pulleys are an ideal compromise between power/torque gains, reliability, and system performance. Our pulley kits have been on the market for over ten years, and used in all of our own cars, with zero component failures related to their use.   Our pulleys are made from T-6061 aluminum and finished in a durable black hard anodize that is very resistant to wear, chemical exposure, and heat. We designed our pulleys to look similar to the factory parts but also to be stronger and, in most cases, slightly lighter too. For example, a Turner alternator pulley is less than half the weight of the stock steel pulley! With our hardcoat aluminum you will never have to worry about a serious failure of a stock plastic pulley. A 'stealth' approach to aesthetics was our goal and we let the results speak for the pulley design. Installation is straight forward and easy with simple hand tools. Removal of the fan is required for access to the front of the engine. Total install time for a 3-piece pulley set should be around 1.5 hours. A new longer belt is included and we also recommend replacing the separate A/C belt, belt tensioners, and the guide and deflection pulleys at the same time.     Bosch or Valeo? BMW built your car with either a Bosch or Valeo brand alternator. Unfortunately, the pulley is not the same for both brands. The brand is usually printed on the black plastic cover of the alternator but may be facing the frame rail or the ground. If you know which brand you have, select your option below and we'll send you the correct alternator pulley for your BMW. Don't know which you have? NO PROBLEM! We can send you both. The 2nd pulley costs $40 but you will receive a refund once we get the un-used pulley back (return shipping not included).     We offer our kits in two different ways: the full Power Pulley Kit with all 3 pulleys or a 2 pulley kit if you do not wish to underdrive your alternator (for large stereo systems or other battery-draining modifications). Our kits have been tested for compatability with the factory premium stereo systems (Harmon Kardon, etc). But any major alterations or upgrades from the factory system will work best with our 2 pulley kit and no underdriving of the alternator. For all stock stereo systems the 3 pulley set is recommended because the Turner alternator pulley will help make more power and is also much lighter than the stock pulley.              1997-1998    Z3 2.8"

This lowers fluid temperatures, resulting in less wear to the pump. This kit also includes a large alternator pulley, which also reduces wear. Kit uses our street water pump ""under drive"" pulley. All of these working together produce a significant gain of over 15 horsepower. The pulley has been track tested on our Grand Am Cup M3's and dyno-tested.

BMW built your car with either a Bosch or Valeo brand alternator. Unfortunately, the pulley is not the same for both brands. The brand is usually printed on the black plastic cover of the alternator but may be facing the frame rail or the ground. If you know which brand you have, select your option below and we'll send you the correct alternator pulley for your BMW. Don't know which you have? NO PROBLEM! We can send you both. The 2nd pulley costs $40 but you will receive a refund once we get the un-used pulley back (return shipping not included).     We offer our kits in two different ways: the full Power Pulley Kit with all 3 pulleys or a 2 pulley kit if you do not wish to underdrive your alternator (for large stereo systems or other battery-draining modifications). Our kits have been tested for compatability with the factory premium stereo systems (Harmon Kardon, etc). But any major alterations or upgrades from the factory system will work best with our 2 pulley kit and no underdriving of the alternator. For all stock stereo systems the 3 pulley set is recommended because the Turner alternator pulley will help make more power and is also much lighter than the stock pulley.              2001-2002    Z3 2.5i"

BMW's N54 had a notoriously rocky start with reliability due to multiple issues such as fuel injectors failing, turbos failing, serpentine belt failure, crank hubs coming loose, and more... BMW made multiple attempts to fix the issues plaguing the N54, but they could only do so much and the fixes rolled out seemed temporary at best. Following the N54, BMW released their updated N55 and S55 engines, giving many people hope that these engines would address the previous issues. Unfortunately, this was only some-what the case. Crank hubs and crank bolts continued to loosen over time and serpentine belts continued to shred themselves and get pulled into the oil pan through the front main seal. For all three engines, this meant a single failure could effectively turn your engine into an oversized paperweight. Luckily for us, the BMW community is full of skilled enthusiasts who have gladly taken up the task to offer solutions! The first headache to be addressed was the Crank Hub and Bolt. Using a simple plate that fits perfectly over your crank hub's hex-head bolt and mounts up against the damper, the crank bolt is effectively locked in place, preventing it from being able to back out until the plate is fully removed. Next up was the serpentine belt failures. It's not known what exactly causes the serpentine belt to split, but once it does, the pieces hanging off of the belt wrap around and behind the damper. This leads to the belt breaking up into smaller pieces and eventually getting pushed between the crank hub and rear main seal into the oil pan. These small pieces of debris get caught in and block the oil pickup, preventing oil flow and leading to engine failure. To prevent this, multiple aftermarket companies came up with their own versions of Crank Seal Plates. This plate is installed behind the front damper, blocking the opening that allows the serpentine belt to pass between the crank hub and seal, keeping debris out of your oil pan! Also included in this kit are the components to service your front Oil Cooler/Filter Housing gaskets, refresh your drive belt system, and install the aftermarket upgrades.

Any accessory that spins from the main drive belt is using up power. That's power that could otherwise be used to move the car. By giving some of that power back to the engine, you can make the car faster! It's like   !   Underdrive pulleys for your BMW will slow down engine-mounted accessories - the water pump, power steering pump, and alternator*. These systems contribute to 'parasitic losses' - power lost from what the engine could produce if it did not have these systems. Since less energy is used to move them, that power is transferred back to the engine and used to propel the car. Our pulleys give a 10-20% reduction in rotation, releasing up to 11hp on most BMW six-cylinder engines. There's also a small but noticeable improvement in throttle response too! We have done extensive testing and development work, both on and off the track, to ensure that the accessory systems function as they should. On our Racing pulley kits we actually underdrive certain components more so we feel our Street pulleys are an ideal compromise between power/torque gains, reliability, and system performance. Our pulley kits have been on the market for over ten years, and used in all of our own cars, with zero component failures related to their use.   Our pulleys are made from T-6061 aluminum and finished in a durable black hard anodize that is very resistant to wear, chemical exposure, and heat. We designed our pulleys to look similar to the factory parts but also to be stronger and, in most cases, slightly lighter too. For example, a Turner alternator pulley is less than half the weight of the stock steel pulley! With our hardcoat aluminum you will never have to worry about a serious failure of a stock plastic pulley. A 'stealth' approach to aesthetics was our goal and we let the results speak for the pulley design. Installation is straight forward and easy with simple hand tools. Removal of the fan is required for access to the front of the engine. Total install time for a 3-piece pulley set should be around 1.5 hours. A new longer belt is included and we also recommend replacing the separate A/C belt, belt tensioners, and the guide and deflection pulleys at the same time.     Bosch or Valeo? BMW built your car with either a Bosch or Valeo brand alternator. Unfortunately, the pulley is not the same for both brands. The brand is usually printed on the black plastic cover of the alternator but may be facing the frame rail or the ground. If you know which brand you have, select your option below and we'll send you the correct alternator pulley for your BMW. Don't know which you have? NO PROBLEM! We can send you both. The 2nd pulley costs $40 but you will receive a refund once we get the un-used pulley back (return shipping not included).     We offer our kits in two different ways: the full Power Pulley Kit with all 3 pulleys or a 2 pulley kit if you do not wish to underdrive your alternator (for large stereo systems or other battery-draining modifications). Our kits have been tested for compatability with the factory premium stereo systems (Harmon Kardon, etc). But any major alterations or upgrades from the factory system will work best with our 2 pulley kit and no underdriving of the alternator. For all stock stereo systems the 3 pulley set is recommended because the Turner alternator pulley will help make more power and is also much lighter than the stock pulley.              1999-2000    Z3 2.3 Z3 2.8"

We know that controlling the harmonic resonance of the BMW 6 is highly important as RPMs rise, but the ideal configuration of the inline-6 motor makes even experienced engine builders overlook some fundamental principals of engine harmonics that can be destructive. ATI Performance Products has partnered with VAC Motorsports to develop new dampers for BMW 2.5L, 2.8L, 3.0L and 3.2L straight-6 engines found in the E36 and E46 M3 as well as newer Z3s and Z4s. These dampers eliminate crankshaft harmonic vibration, which allows the engine to produce more horsepower and torque, while also reducing internal engine wear at the same time. Broken oil pumps and timing chains will be a thing of the past! When used with a VAC accessory pulley, these dampers are a direct replacement over the OEM balancer. They have a 7” outer diameter and include OEM style timing alignment tabs. BMW enthusiasts should know that all ATI Super Dampers exceed SFI 18.1 Safety Certification and are approved for competition. The advantages of the ATI SuperDamper include eliminating vibration issues with inline 6 engines equipped with lightweight clutch and flywheel assemblies, reduced bearing, engine accessories, oil pump wear, and compatibility with underdrive pulleys. Kit includes: Damper Lightweight VAC Billet Crankshaft Pulley Mounting and Installation Hardware Trigger Ring for OBD1 systems Note: Will NOT work with S50B30 & S50B32 Euro Engines, For Street/Track cars with Air Conditioning, the Additional A/C Pulley Option is REQUIRED as the OE A/C pulley is not compatible.

We offer our kits in two different ways: the full Power Pulley Kit with all 3 pulleys or as a 2 pulley kit if you do not wish to underdrive your alternator (for large stereo systems or other critical-charging modifications). Our kits have been tested for compatability with the factory premium stereo systems (Harmon Kardon, etc). But any major upgrades from the factory premium systems will work best with our 2 pulley kit and no underdriving of the alternator. For all stock stereo systems the full 3-piece set is recommended because the Turner alternator pulley will help make more power and is also much lighter than the stock pulley."

BMW's N54 had a notoriously rocky start with reliability due to multiple issues such as fuel injectors failing, turbos failing, serpentine belt failure, crank hubs coming loose, and more... BMW made multiple attempts to fix the issues plaguing the N54, but they could only do so much and the fixes rolled out seemed temporary at best. Following the N54, BMW released their updated N55 and S55 engines, giving many people hope that these engines would address the previous issues. Unfortunately, this was only some-what the case. Crank hubs and crank bolts continued to loosen over time and serpentine belts continued to shred themselves and get pulled into the oil pan through the front main seal. For all three engines, this meant a single failure could effectively turn your engine into an oversized paperweight. Luckily for us, the BMW community is full of skilled enthusiasts who have gladly taken up the task to offer solutions! The first headache to be addressed was the Crank Hub and Bolt. Using a simple plate that fits perfectly over your crank hub's hex-head bolt and mounts up against the damper, the crank bolt is effectively locked in place, preventing it from being able to back out until the plate is fully removed. Next up was the serpentine belt failures. It's not known what exactly causes the serpentine belt to split, but once it does, the pieces hanging off of the belt wrap around and behind the damper. This leads to the belt breaking up into smaller pieces and eventually getting pushed between the crank hub and rear main seal into the oil pan. These small pieces of debris get caught in and block the oil pickup, preventing oil flow and leading to engine failure. To prevent this, multiple aftermarket companies came up with their own versions of Crank Seal Plates. This plate is installed behind the front damper, blocking the opening that allows the serpentine belt to pass between the crank hub and seal, keeping debris out of your oil pan! Also included in this kit are the components to service your front Oil Cooler/Filter Housing gaskets, refresh your drive belt system, and install the aftermarket upgrades.

This S54 racing alternator pulley underdrives the alternator more than our standard Power Pulley, freeing up horsepower and reducing alternator wear. This pulley is over 70% larger than the original stock pulley. With less electrical load, you don't need the original alternator output anymore. You can drive the alternator less and return that ""lost"" horsepower back to the engine. This part was developed and race-proven on our E46 Touring Cars. Because this pulley is so much larger than the original (70%), special care will need to be taken so that it does not interfere wtih other components on the engine - power steering lines, oil cooler lines, coolant hoses, etc. This pulley is strictly for race/track cars only, due to the size of the alternator pulley the proper voltage cannot be maintained at low RPM.

Any accessory that spins from the main drive belt is using up power. That's power that could otherwise be used to move the car. By giving some of that power back to the engine, you can make the car faster! It's like   !   Underdrive pulleys for your BMW will slow down engine-mounted accessories - the water pump, power steering pump, and alternator*. These systems contribute to 'parasitic losses' - power lost from what the engine could produce if it did not have these systems. Since less energy is used to move them, that power is transferred back to the engine and used to propel the car. Our pulleys give a 10-20% reduction in rotation, releasing up to 11hp on most BMW six-cylinder engines. There's also a small but noticeable improvement in throttle response too! We have done extensive testing and development work, both on and off the track, to ensure that the accessory systems function as they should. On our Racing pulley kits we actually underdrive certain components more so we feel our Street pulleys are an ideal compromise between power/torque gains, reliability, and system performance. Our pulley kits have been on the market for over ten years, and used in all of our own cars, with zero component failures related to their use.   Our pulleys are made from T-6061 aluminum and finished in a durable black hard anodize that is very resistant to wear, chemical exposure, and heat. We designed our pulleys to look similar to the factory parts but also to be stronger and, in most cases, slightly lighter too. For example, a Turner alternator pulley is less than half the weight of the stock steel pulley! With our hardcoat aluminum you will never have to worry about a serious failure of a stock plastic pulley. A 'stealth' approach to aesthetics was our goal and we let the results speak for the pulley design. Installation is straight forward and easy with simple hand tools. Removal of the fan is required for access to the front of the engine. Total install time for a 3-piece pulley set should be around 1.5 hours. A new longer belt is included and we also recommend replacing the separate A/C belt, belt tensioners, and the guide and deflection pulleys at the same time.       BMW built your car with either a Bosch or Valeo brand alternator. Unfortunately, the pulley is not the same for both brands. The brand is usually printed on the black plastic cover of the alternator but may be facing the frame rail or the ground. If you know which brand you have, select your option below and we'll send you the correct alternator pulley for your BMW. Don't know which you have? NO PROBLEM! We can send you both. The 2nd pulley costs $40 but you will receive a refund once we get the un-used pulley back (return shipping not included).     We offer our kits in two different ways: the full Power Pulley Kit with all 3 pulleys or a 2 pulley kit if you do not wish to underdrive your alternator (for large stereo systems or other battery-draining modifications). Our kits have been tested for compatability with the factory premium stereo systems (Harmon Kardon, etc). But any major alterations or upgrades from the factory system will work best with our 2 pulley kit and no underdriving of the alternator. For all stock stereo systems the 3 pulley set is recommended because the Turner alternator pulley will help make more power and is also much lighter than the stock pulley.              2001-2002    Z3 3.0i"

We have seen these plastic or composite pulleys crack around the mounting bolt holes. If left un-noticed the whole pulley can fall apart which will immediately disable the car and possibly leave you stranded. It can also break while performing other work around it such as removing the fan, replacing the water pump, or even just replacing the belt. Replacing this pulley while doing the water pump can be a good preventative measure.   This pulley is available in two different styles - the stock plastic or a stronger aluminum version. The same drawbacks with the stock pulley also apply to this plastic version. But if you're replacing the water pump on a regular basis then you should also replace the plastic pulley. The aluminum pulley will obviously last much longer. Both are the same size as the stock original pulley.     1992-1998    323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3  1997-1998    528i  1997-1998    Z3 2.8  1998-2000    M Roadster M Coupe"
