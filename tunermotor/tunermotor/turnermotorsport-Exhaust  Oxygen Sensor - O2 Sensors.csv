When your BMW oxygen sensor fails, the computer can no longer sense the air/fuel ratio, so it ends up guessing -- resulting in poor performance, poor gas mileage, and increased pollution. Make sure your BMW engine performs as it should, and doesn't use more fuel than it needs to, by simply changing your oxygen sensor today. There is no lifespan on O2 sensors but there are several fault codes that indicate a failed sensor (O2 monitoring, cat efficiency, O2 heating circuit, O2 readiness, and others). The O2 sensor is heated and has a self-calibration feature so once you get the codes or feel performance has suffered, a new sensor is a good starting point to get you back to peak performance.

Make sure your BMW engine performs as it should, and doesn't use more fuel than it needs to, by simply changing your oxygen sensor today. There is no lifespan on O2 sensors but there are several fault codes that indicate a failed sensor (O2 monitoring, cat efficiency, O2 heating circuit, O2 readiness, and others). The O2 sensor is heated and has a self-calibration feature so once you get the codes or feel performance has suffered, a new sensor is a good starting point to get you back to peak performance. This is the OEM oxygen sensor for BMWs with B46, B48, and N74 engines. As a leading source of high-performance BMW parts and accessories since 1993, we at Turner Motorsport are honored to be the go-to supplier for tens of thousands of enthusiasts the world over. With over two decades of parts, service, and racing experience under our belt, we provide only quality performance and replacement parts. All of our performance parts are those we would (and do!) install and run on our own cars, as well as replacement parts that are Genuine BMW or from OEM manufacturers. We only offer parts we know you can trust to perform!"

Make sure your BMW engine performs as it should, and doesn't use more fuel than it needs to, by simply changing your oxygen sensor today. There is no lifespan on O2 sensors but there are several fault codes that indicate a failed sensor (O2 monitoring, cat efficiency, O2 heating circuit, O2 readiness, and others). The O2 sensor is heated and has a self-calibration feature so once you get the codes or feel performance has suffered, a new sensor is a good starting point to get you back to peak performance. Bosch's Oxygen sensors are high quality and will give you the longest and best performance for the price. Bosch is one of the largest OEM producers of Genuine BMW and aftermarket parts in the world, providing parts for almost every major automotive manufacturer. Bosch has likely supplied many of the original electrical (and mechanical) parts for your BMW. Thanks to their quality, high durability, and reliability, you should expect a long service life from Bosch products. As a leading source of high-performance BMW parts and accessories since 1993, we at Turner Motorsport are honored to be the go-to supplier for tens of thousands of enthusiasts the world over. With over two decades of parts, service, and racing experience under our belt, we provide only quality performance and replacement parts. All of our performance parts are those we would (and do!) install and run on our own cars, as well as replacement parts that are Genuine BMW or from OEM manufacturers. We only offer parts we know you can trust to perform!"
