Power output is increased by 20 horsepower, from 300hp to 320hp. This results in faster acceleration from 0 to 60 mph (0.2 seconds faster than the standard model) and from 50 mph to 75 mph (0.5 seconds faster than the standard model). Even with this increased power, the fuel consumption and emissions ratings remain the same as they were with the standard model. The Power Kit also adds a very sporty exhaust burbling noise during engine overrun conditions. BMW Power Kits are the only form of ""tuning kits"" approved and covered under the BMW of North America limited warranty.
