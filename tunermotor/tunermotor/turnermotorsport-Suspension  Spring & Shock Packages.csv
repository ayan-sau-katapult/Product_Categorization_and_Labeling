They key to taking corners faster and reducing bodyroll is to firm up the suspension and we start with the shocks and springs.   H&R Sport springs lower the ride height 1.3"" front and rear and stiffens the spring rate. Both combine to lower the car's center of gravity and reduce the amount of bodyroll in corners. The springs are progressive rate so their initial stiffness is actually very compliant and it becomes stiffer as the spring is compressed. This is great for street cars that see bumps and potholes where suspension compliance is key. Overall, they are about 30% stiffer than the stock original springs. Lowering amount will be less if replacing the factory sport suspension.   We use Bilstein Sport shocks as the dampers and they feature Bilstein's patented and innovative valving system. With this system, small bumps and impacts are absorbed as they should be. But the shocks stiffen for cornering and other suspension motions. It's the best of both worlds as the shock self-adjusts based on suspension motion.

The E46 Sport Cup Kit is a more aggressive version of the Touring kit. The ride height lowers the center of gravity and roll center even more and the springs are stiffer for more control over body motions and weight transfer. The Sport Cup Kit lowers the ride height as much as 2.1"" in front and 1.7"" in the back. The springs are still progressive rate so the ride stays compliant on small bumps but quickly gets stiffer. Overall, they are about 50% stiffer than the stock original springs. Lowering amount will be less if replacing the factory sport suspension. If you want a very precise and firm suspension, and ride quality is secondary, the Sport Cup Kit is superior to the Touring or any other shock/spring package we offer. This package fits with the stock strut and shock mounts but front camber plates are recommended because of the increased front negative camber.    This H&R Cup Kit is a tuned shock/spring package for the E46 coupe and sedan. H&R matches a set of springs to performance shocks for a perfectly setup and functioning suspension package. Instead of mixing and matching springs with shocks, H&R has tailored each shock for the specific model, taking into account spring rates, chassis setup, and suspension motions.

Where a Bilstein Sport is a true performance shock, the factory Sachs sport shocks are milder and easier on rough pavement. For a lowered height and prime ride comfort choose this H&R/Sachs kit. For the ultimate performance shock/spring package, choose the H&R/Bilstein kit.   H&R Sport springs lower the ride height by up to 1.3"" in front and .75"" in the rear depending on if the car has the factory sport suspension or not. The spring rate is also stiffer. Both combine to lower the car's center of gravity and reduce the amount of bodyroll in corners. The springs are progressive rate so their initial stiffness is actually very compliant and it becomes stiffer as the spring is compressed. This is great for street cars that see bumps and potholes where suspension compliance is key. Overall, they are about 30% stiffer than the stock original springs.   Because this package uses the stock OEM sport shocks this can be a great upgrade for a non-sport car or a direct refreshening for a car with sport package.

BUY A PAIR FOR THE PRICE OF FACTORY SINGLE! The rear springs on the 2001-2005 E46 325xi and 330xi models have a chronic broken spring problem. If it hasn't happened to you yet it will. Springs are nothing more than exposed steel and they rust easily. After a while, a section of the spring actually breaks off. The typical Xi was sold in markets with heavy salt and moisture anyway and water can pool in the bottom spring pad. A broken spring is very dangerous - the spring is no longer mounted correctly in the suspension and it cannot support the weight of the car, especially when cornering. The ride also suffers as the suspension is no longer able to absorb the bumps and impacts from the road. Aside from a visual inspection of the spring itself you might notice a clunking sound or banging noise coming from the front or rear. An inspection of the noise should also include other related items in the suspension: bushings, ball joints, links, mounts, etc. We also recommend replacing the rubber spring pads on the top and bottom of the spring because they lose their shape over time. Check if your car has 5mm or 15mm thick pads. The factory BMW springs sell for $140+ each. We sold and replaced enough while working in New England that we were able to get a strong grasp of the issue and come up with our own springs that are an improvement over the factory springs in every way. These springs are made in Germany using high-grade spring steel that is then shot-peened for longer life and powder-coated for protection. These are the same height as the stock replacement BMW springs which makes them a direct replacement. Sold only as a pair."

This MINI shock/spring package uses stiffer and shorter springs to reduce bodyroll and better control weight transfer. The lower and stiffer suspension will allow more speed to be carried through corners with more confidance.   H&R Sport springs lower the ride height 1.0"" front and 0.75"" in the rear and stiffens the spring rate. Both combine to lower the car's center of gravity and reduce the amount of bodyroll in corners. The springs are progressive rate so their initial stiffness is actually very compliant and it becomes stiffer as the spring is compressed. This is great for street cars that see bumps and potholes where suspension compliance is key. Overall, they are about 30% stiffer than the stock original springs.    We use Bilstein Sport shocks as the dampers and they feature Bilstein's patented and innovative valving system. With this system, small bumps and impacts are absorbed as they should be. But the shocks stiffen for cornering and other suspension motions. It's the best of both worlds as the shock self-adjusts based on suspension motion. These fit with the stock strut and shock mounts, making for an easy and clean install.       2002-2006    MINI Cooper S"

Lowering the suspension and using a stiffer spring will make the MINI feel more sprightly. There will be less bodyroll and better balance to keep your speed up in the corners. The firmer suspension will make the car more stable and easier to drive when pushing the car through the corners. Since the springs are firmer, there will be a corresponding increase in the stiffness of the ride but with the Bilstein sport shocks it will always be composed and controlled.   H&R Sport springs lower the ride height 1.3"" front and 1.2"" in the rear and stiffens the spring rate. Both combine to lower the car's center of gravity and reduce the amount of bodyroll in corners.

The stock shock and spring package is a bit too soft and mushy with a lot of bodyroll. Even the factory sport suspension was a marginal improvement. If you have been left wanting more from your stock suspension, this is the perfect upgrade. In this E46 shock and spring package we paired H&R Sport springs with a set of Bilstein sport shocks and struts to deliver a package with near-stock levels of comfort but with stiffer springs that improve handling and lower the ride height for better aesthetics."
