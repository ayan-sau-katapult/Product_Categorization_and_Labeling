You can also record data for later analysis - up to 10 hours of running data! It also works as a timing meter for 0-60, 1/8 mile, 60' acceleration, 330' acceleration, and 1,000' acceleration time. You can plug the AccessPort into a PC or Mac and view all of this saved data in their program. This information is invaluable for evaluating engine performance and performance modifications.     With access to the OBD port, the Cobb tuner can also read and reset Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). This saves you a trip to the dealer or local shop simply to have a fault code interpreted. Now you can pull these codes and get an answer to the problem right away! The code number and a brief description of the code is given so you won't even have to search for it online. Reset the code and you're on your way (unless the code comes back...).

Cobb engineers are constantly revising and tuning their files to extract the most horsepower with the least effect on reliability and drivability. Updated files and new maps for additional modifications are available direct from Cobb.              2011    135i 135is  2011    335i 335xi 335i xDrive - Sedan  2011    335i 335xi 335i xDrive - Coupe  2011    335i - Convertible"

P3 Cars developed this extension harness for use with their wonderful P3 Gauges but it serves other purposes too. The main feature is the low profile plug that is connected to the car's factory OBD port (by the driver's ankle or knee). With the P3 Gauge or other OBD tools, the plug can be large and bulky which can interfere with installation or unplugging the unit. In some cases, the installation requires you to modify the cover for the OBD port for a seamless install. But with the slim design of the P3 extension harness, it fits out of sight in almost every application."
