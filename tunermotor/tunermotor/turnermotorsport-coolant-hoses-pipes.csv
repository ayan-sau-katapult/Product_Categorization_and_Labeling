These earlier engines use a fitting to secure the heater hose to the front engine cover. The 3.2 and 2.8 liter engines do not have this fitting. This is also needed if you are doing an E30 3.2 or 2.8 engine conversion using OBD-I electronics.

Designed using durable silicone and billet aluminum to greatly outlast the OE rubber and plastic combination. Some of the weakest points of the cooling systems in BMW's can come down to the OE plastic fittings breaking down from the constant changes in temperature, softening these plastic components. When this happens, even simply moving the hose slightly could cause the fitting to crack, causing the coolant to leak all over. The ECS design silicone hose with billet aluminum adapter retains OE fitment with superior strength to not only handle the performance, but also stand up to the wear and tear of a daily driver. Features: Manufactured from billet 6061-T6 and type III anodized for exceptional durability and corrosion resistance. Much stronger part than OEM plastic Will not become brittle and fatigue over time due to thermal cycling. This will prevent the part from breaking during removal and re-installation. Constructed of 4-Ply reinforced silicone for improved durability over the failure-prone OE rubber hose. Flourosilicone lined internal layer for exceptional chemical resistance. Silicone offers reduced thermal conductivity as well as improved resistance to ozone and UV degradation for improved performance and durability. Follows OEM form for perfect fitment.

Designed using durable silicone and billet aluminum to greatly outlast the OE rubber and plastic combination. Some of the weakest points of the cooling systems in BMW's can come down to the OE plastic fittings breaking down from the constant changes in temperature, softening these plastic components. When this happens, even simply moving the hose slightly could cause the fitting to crack, causing the coolant to leak all over. The ECS design silicone hose with billet aluminum adapter retains OE fitment with superior strength to not only handle the performance, but also stand up to the wear and tear of a daily driver. Features: Manufactured from billet 6061-T6 and type III anodized for exceptional durability and corrosion resistance. Much stronger part than OEM plastic Will not become brittle and fatigue over time due to thermal cycling. This will prevent the part from breaking during removal and re-installation. Constructed of 4-Ply reinforced silicone for improved durability over the failure-prone OE rubber hose. Flourosilicone lined internal layer for exceptional chemical resistance. Silicone offers reduced thermal conductivity as well as improved resistance to ozone and UV degradation for improved performance and durability. Follows OEM form for perfect fitment.

Designed using durable silicone and billet aluminum to greatly outlast the OE rubber and plastic combination.

When this happens, even simply moving the hose slightly could cause the fitting to crack, causing the coolant to leak all over. The ECS design silicone hose with billet aluminum adapter retains OE fitment with superior strength to not only handle the performance, but also stand up to the wear and tear of a daily driver. Features: Manufactured from billet 6061-T6 and type III anodized for exceptional durability and corrosion resistance. Much stronger part than OEM plastic Will not become brittle and fatigue over time due to thermal cycling. This will prevent the part from breaking during removal and re-installation. Constructed of 4-Ply reinforced silicone for improved durability over the failure-prone OE rubber hose. Flourosilicone lined internal layer for exceptional chemical resistance. Silicone offers reduced thermal conductivity as well as improved resistance to ozone and UV degradation for improved performance and durability. Follows OEM form for perfect fitment.

Designed using durable silicone and billet aluminum to greatly outlast the OE rubber and plastic combination. Some of the weakest points of the cooling systems in BMW's can come down to the OE plastic fittings breaking down from the constant changes in temperature, softening these plastic components. When this happens, even simply moving the hose slightly could cause the fitting to crack, causing the coolant to leak all over. The ECS design silicone hose with billet aluminum adapter retains OE fitment with superior strength to not only handle the performance, but also stand up to the wear and tear of a daily driver. Features: Manufactured from billet 6061-T6 and type III anodized for exceptional durability and corrosion resistance. Much stronger part than OEM plastic Will not become brittle and fatigue over time due to thermal cycling. This will prevent the part from breaking during removal and re-installation. Constructed of 4-Ply reinforced silicone for improved durability over the failure-prone OE rubber hose. Flourosilicone lined internal layer for exceptional chemical resistance. Silicone offers reduced thermal conductivity as well as improved resistance to ozone and UV degradation for improved performance and durability. Follows OEM form for perfect fitment.

The cooler (heat exchanger) is a part of the overall cooling system and uses coolant circulated from the regular cooling system to cool the transmission oil running through this small cooling block. Some of the hoses are shared with the rest of the cooling system as well. The E38/E39 heat exchanger is located along the driver's side frame rail and is accessed from the wheel well. We recommend servicing or cleaning the heat exchanger along with any cooling system overhaul. Or if you're having transmission faults (especially for temperature) you may want to clean the transmission cooler anyway and these hoses will be a nice finishing touch.   Replacing or cleaning the heat exchanger components could lead to better shifting of the automatic as the cooler itself can become clogged. If you're experiencing harder or hesitating shifts, and the internal transmission temperature is rising without being regulated, the components in this system are the likely cause. Staying on top of the cooling needs of the transmission will help prevent a very costly transmission repair in the future. These hoses are easily replaced and you can clean the heat exchanger easily with brake cleaner and some brushes.   Included in this handy package are:"
