https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-640500-power-steering-reservoir/,Bav Auto Power Steering Reservoir - Multple BMWs,640500,32411097164,$12.95,"This is a replacement power steering fluid reservoir. Why replace the reservoir? Because the connection between the reservoir tank and the hoses is one of the prime locations for power steering leaks on these cars. It's mostly due to the style of clamp that BMW used. But also any replacement clamps are usually over-tightened on these plastic reservoir nipples. There is also a filter inside the reservoir that cannot be changed or serviced. So it's a good idea to replace the tank and get a new filter at the same time. With fresh fluid and a clean filter you might be able to restore some steering smoothness and precision to your BMW!
