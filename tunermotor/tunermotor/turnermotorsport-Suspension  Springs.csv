A progressive spring will typically be softer at light loads, then dramatically stiffen as compression increases. This makes it very hard to match dampening, and creates the bouncy feeling over light bumps. The linear design of these springs have a consistent rate as the spring sees higher load. On light bumps, it will allow the chassis to follow the road well (minimizing the bouncy feeling), while under heavy compression it will stiffen to prevent bottoming out. In our experience, this creates a much better overall ride quality. Compatible with adaptive suspension. Lowering of 1.3"" front and .3"" rear."

This spring set will make a subtle yet noticeable visual improvement to the X5M's stance, reducing the perceived fender gap of the stock ride height.    We have these springs on our Project F85 X5M and they transforms the handling into more of what (we feel) this car should feel like -- sharp cornering with only a small sacrifice in ride quality. The ride is still very compliant and well suited for city streets, keeping the ride quality very close to the stock ride comfort. Now that's a well engineered set of springs!

These were originally modeled after BMW Motorsport's spring set for Group N racing in Europe. Now made by H&R we have spec'd these springs in a progressive rate in the front up to 680lbs and the rear up to 1026lbs. This makes them over twice as stiff as H&R's own racing springs and a better match for true racecars used for club racing, time trials, autocross, and more. We set the handling balance for the full ""J-Stock"" suspension to have a very slight tendency to understeer based on feedback from our fastest customers.

If it hasn't happened to you yet it will. Springs are nothing more than exposed steel and they rust easily. After a while a section of the spring actually breaks off. Typically the X3 was popular in markets with heavy salt and moisture anyway and water can pool in the bottom spring pad.   A broken spring is very dangerous - the spring is no longer mounted correctly in the suspension and it cannot support the weight of the car, especially when cornering. The ride also suffers as the suspension is no longer able to absorb the bumps and impacts from the road. Aside from a visual inspection of the spring itself you might notice a clunking sound or banging noise coming from the front or rear. An inspection of the noise should also include other related items in the suspension: bushings, ball joints, links, mounts, etc. We also recommend replacing the rubber spring pads on the top and bottom of the spring because they lose their shape over time.

Not only that, but the repairs never seem to be permanent, whether its a sensor going off a leaky air bag or the compressor. Get rid of these problems for good, with this Coil Spring conversion kit. Using OEM springs will give you similar ride height as the air ride without compromising handling or comfort."
