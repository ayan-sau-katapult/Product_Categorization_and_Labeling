On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade. This is where Two-Piece Floating rotors start to shine. Two-Piece rotors were designed specifically for high-performance applications and are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Needless to say, we aren't a fan of our track days being cut short due to braking issues, so we decided to create our very own performance-oriented TrackSport Rotors! Our TrackSport rotors feature a full floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse.

On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade. This is where Two-Piece Floating rotors start to shine. Two-Piece rotors were designed specifically for high-performance applications and are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Needless to say, we aren't a fan of our track days being cut short due to braking issues, so we decided to create our very own performance-oriented TrackSport Rotors! Our TrackSport rotors feature a full floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. Additionally, thanks to these rotor's inherent two-piece design and the included Aluminum rotor hats, these remove almost 20% of the rotational mass versus stock rotors.

This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. When considering a brake rotor upgrade, it's important to factor in their specific use. On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade."

These rotors feature a unique black electro-coating that is designed to prevent corrosion. Each rotor is e-coated then double-ground and balanced to ensure an even surface with no vibration. The e-coating is the best anti-corrosion protection currently available in replacement rotors. Most aftermarket rotors are not coated, allowing surface rust to form right away, which is unattractive when brakes can be seen through your wheels.    Slotting a rotor helps to release gases that build up between the rotor surface and an out-gassing brake pad. Without an escape, this thin layer of gas will cause a delay until the pad cuts through gas layer. The slots in our rotors allow the gases to escape giving better braking performance. For track and racing use, slotting is preferred over cross-drilling because the slots don't take away as much mass from the rotor and won't suffer from structural cracks.

This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. When considering a brake rotor upgrade, it's important to factor in their specific use. On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade."

On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade. This is where Two-Piece Floating rotors start to shine. Two-Piece rotors were designed specifically for high-performance applications and are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Needless to say, we aren't a fan of our track days being cut short due to braking issues, so we decided to create our very own performance-oriented TrackSport Rotors! Our TrackSport rotors feature a full floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. Additionally, thanks to these rotor's inherent two-piece design and the included Aluminum rotor hats, these remove almost 20% of the rotational mass versus stock rotors.

Oftentimes these phosphate coatings are only preventative during shipping and storage, resulting in immediate visible corrosion once exposed to heat and moisture on your vehicle. ECS's Electrostatic Coating is tested to endure 400 hours of salt spray exposure without rusting to save you the headache that comes from both the unappealing aesthetic of rusty rotors and associated run out issues. ECS V4 Rotors have a fully machined finish to promote superior rotor balance and to give your car an attractive rotor that peeks out from behind your beloved wheels. ECS's V4 Rotors are designed to have a double disc ground, taper free finish - this prevents run out through guaranteed parallelism and accurate disc thickness variation (DTV). This process prevents the finish from being directional, facilitating a more effective pad and rotor break-in period, along with smooth, silent stopping power for the life of the rotors. ECS V4 Cross Drilled and Slotted rotors will give your vehicle track appeal, complimenting the rest of your wheel and suspension setup. Slotted rotors are designed to prevent brake dust and debris buildup from inhibiting performance, giving you more consistent brake feel. Cross drilled rotors keep your braking system cooler, thus reducing brake fade. Combining both cross-drilled and slotted rotor types gives you more reliable performance whether you're in stop-and-go traffic or driving in wet road conditions. ECS Tuning carefully controls the cooling rate during the manufacturing process to ensure that the drilled and slotted rotors meet or exceed tensile strength requirements.

Oftentimes these phosphate coatings are only preventative during shipping and storage, resulting in immediate visible corrosion once exposed to heat and moisture on your vehicle. ECS's Electrostatic Coating is tested to endure 400 hours of salt spray exposure without rusting to save you the headache that comes from both the unappealing aesthetic of rusty rotors and associated run out issues. ECS V4 Rotors have a fully machined finish to promote superior rotor balance and to give your car an attractive rotor that peeks out from behind your beloved wheels. ECS's V4 Rotors are designed to have a double disc ground, taper free finish - this prevents run out through guaranteed parallelism and accurate disc thickness variation (DTV). This process prevents the finish from being directional, facilitating a more effective pad and rotor break-in period, along with smooth, silent stopping power for the life of the rotors. ECS V4 Cross Drilled and Slotted rotors will give your vehicle track appeal, complimenting the rest of your wheel and suspension setup. Slotted rotors are designed to prevent brake dust and debris buildup from inhibiting performance, giving you more consistent brake feel. Cross drilled rotors keep your braking system cooler, thus reducing brake fade. Combining both cross-drilled and slotted rotor types gives you more reliable performance whether you're in stop-and-go traffic or driving in wet road conditions. ECS Tuning carefully controls the cooling rate during the manufacturing process to ensure that the drilled and slotted rotors meet or exceed tensile strength requirements. Additionally, V4 Cross Drilled and Slotted Rotors are designed independently for the left and right side of your vehicle, ensuring that the drilled holes do not touch any cooling vanes. Features: V4 Cross Drilled and Slotted Rotors Electrostatic Rust-Inhibiting Coating Fully Machined Finish Surface Roughness production standard: RMS = 64.3, Ra = 1.6 micrometers Individually inspected for balance, and mill corrected Symmetric, OE Style Vane Casting Engineered to meet all OE specs, along with QS and ISO Quality System Standards"

On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade. This is where Two-Piece Floating rotors start to shine. Two-Piece rotors were designed specifically for high-performance applications and are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Needless to say, we aren't a fan of our track days being cut short due to braking issues, so we decided to create our very own performance-oriented TrackSport Rotors! These TrackSport rotors feature a semi-floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. Additionally, thanks to these rotor's inherent two-piece design and the included Aluminum rotor hats, these remove almost 20% of the rotational mass versus stock rotors.

On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade. This is where Two-Piece Floating rotors start to shine. Two-Piece rotors were designed specifically for high-performance applications and are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Needless to say, we aren't a fan of our track days being cut short due to braking issues, so we decided to create our very own performance-oriented TrackSport Rotors! Our TrackSport rotors feature a full floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. Additionally, thanks to these rotor's inherent two-piece design and the included Aluminum rotor hats, these remove almost 20% of the rotational mass versus stock rotors.

Oftentimes these phosphate coatings are only preventative during shipping and storage, resulting in immediate visible corrosion once exposed to heat and moisture on your vehicle. ECS's Electrostatic Coating is tested to endure 400 hours of salt spray exposure without rusting to save you the headache that comes from both the unappealing aesthetic of rusty rotors and associated run out issues. ECS V4 Rotors have a fully machined finish to promote superior rotor balance and to give your car an attractive rotor that peeks out from behind your beloved wheels. ECS's V4 Rotors are designed to have a double disc ground, taper free finish - this prevents run out through guaranteed parallelism and accurate disc thickness variation (DTV). This process prevents the finish from being directional, facilitating a more effective pad and rotor break-in period, along with smooth, silent stopping power for the life of the rotors.

This process prevents the finish from being directional, facilitating a more effective pad and rotor break-in period, along with smooth, silent stopping power for the life of the rotors. ECS V4 Cross Drilled rotors will give your car track appeal, complimenting the rest of your wheel and suspension setup. Having cross drilled rotors keeps your brakes cooler and reduces brake fade, giving you more consistent brake performance in all driving conditions. ECS carefully controls the cooling rate during the manufacturing process to ensure that their drilled rotors meet or exceed tensile strength requirements. Additionally, V4 Cross Drilled Rotors are designed independently for the left and right side of your vehicle, ensuring that the drilled holes do not touch cooling vanes. Features: ​Electrostatic Rust-Inhibiting Coating Fully Machined Finish Surface Roughness production standard: RMS = 64.3, Ra = 1.6 micrometers Individually inspected for balance, and mill corrected Symmetric, OE Style Vane Casting Engineered to meet all OE specs, along with QS and ISO Quality System Standards"

They are are an ideal alternative to the pricey factory rotors.   Centric Parts is one of the leading OEM and performance brake manufacturers operating in the world today. Not content to offer BMW owners the standard cast iron brake disc, Centric and StopTech started from the ground up to offer a higher quality product than even what the original manufacturers were offering. High Carbon literally means the metallurgy has been specially formulated for use with European brake pad formulas to bring improved braking performance, resist rotor cracking, and reduced pad squeal. The Centric/Stoptech-exclusive E-Coating is electro-statically applied to the entire rotor (inside and out) to withstand premature corrosion.

Oftentimes these phosphate coatings are only preventative during shipping and storage, resulting in immediate visible corrosion once exposed to heat and moisture on your vehicle. ECS's Electrostatic Coating is tested to endure 400 hours of salt spray exposure without rusting to save you the headache that comes from both the unappealing aesthetic of rusty rotors and associated run out issues. ECS V4 Rotors have a fully machined finish to promote superior rotor balance and to give your car an attractive rotor that peeks out from behind your beloved wheels. ECS's V4 Rotors are designed to have a double disc ground, taper free finish - this prevents run out through guaranteed parallelism and accurate disc thickness variation (DTV). This process prevents the finish from being directional, facilitating a more effective pad and rotor break-in period, along with smooth, silent stopping power for the life of the rotors. ECS V4 Cross Drilled rotors will give your car track appeal, complimenting the rest of your wheel and suspension setup. Having cross drilled rotors keeps your brakes cooler and reduces brake fade, giving you more consistent brake performance in all driving conditions. ECS carefully controls the cooling rate during the manufacturing process to ensure that their drilled rotors meet or exceed tensile strength requirements. Additionally, V4 Cross Drilled Rotors are designed independently for the left and right side of your vehicle, ensuring that the drilled holes do not touch cooling vanes.

Although the ARK is the same diameter and thickness as the factory rotors, it offers improved cooling, braking, and handling. The directional, floating AeroRotors allow independent expansion of the rotor and hat without ""coning,"" thanks to elongated drive pin holes. ARK components include AeroRotor friction rings with patented internal vane design, pre-assembled to billet aluminium AeroHats with directional stand-offs that optimize cooling airflow. The patented AeroRotor vane design pushes up to 80% more air than factory rotors for better cooling and reduced fade on the track. The aircraft-grade aluminum hats and 2-piece AeroRotors are up to 8 pounds lighter than stock rotors, allowing faster acceleration and deceleration, and improved handling. StopTech AeroRotors are available slotted or cross-drilled. These slots or holes allow better dissipation of heat, friction material and debris, assuring that fresh pad material is in contact with the rotor every time the brakes are applied. An optional anti-corrosion, zinc finish is available for customers in cold climates, where salt and chemicals are used to melt snow and ice. The zinc coating also benefits customers who prefer no visible surface rust on the vanes and outer circumference of the rotors. StopTech AeroRotors are 100% made in the USA. StopTech AeroRotor Rings The patented 2-piece AeroRotor assembly uses uniquely designed and patented AeroVanes inside the disc to optimize airflow through the rotor. This improved directional design minimizes turbulence and flows up to 61 percent more air than any other rotor tested. The result is up to 80 percent better airflow over original equipment rotors and 10-30 percent better airflow than other directional vane racing rotors currently available. Better airflow equals better cooling, and better cooling means less fade and better overall brake system performance. StopTech AeroRotors also feature proprietary alloy chemistry. By adding molybdenum to the gray iron, carefully targeting a narrow range of hardness and tensile strength values, and controlling the cooling rate of the rotor after casting, StopTech produces a friction ring with added crack resistance as well as improved functionality. Drive Pins Super strong Inconel drive pin washers - as used in aircraft engines and other racing applications - are practically impervious to oxidation or corrosion even at extreme temperatures. Street rotors use a curved drive pin washer to add tension to the hat assembly, reducing rattle. Race applications use a flat washer that allows full freedom of movement between hat and friction ring. StopTech AeroHats feature directional stand offs to further improve airflow and cool the rotor. Elongated drive pin slots allow separate expansion of rotor and hat to resist coning. Tapered slots allow evacuation of debris that might otherwise accumulate with straight-cut slots. Drive pins used to affix the hat to the rotor have a slightly out-of-round hole and are self-locking. They withstand high temperatures much better than typical lock washers and allow drive pins to move freely, yet securely, as hat and rotor expand at different rates. In certain applications where packaging is an issue - such as on the Chevrolet Corvette - StopTech uses slant-head drive pins to provide improved clearance as pads wear. Zinc Plating ​Zinc Plating, available on StopTech AeroRotors, prevents corrosion. This is particularly useful in winter climates where road salt and other environmental factors may increase the likelihood of oxidation."

ECS V4 Rotors have a fully machined finish to promote superior rotor balance and to give your car an attractive rotor that peeks out from behind your beloved wheels. ECS's V4 Rotors are designed to have a double disc ground, taper free finish - this prevents run out through guaranteed parallelism and accurate disc thickness variation (DTV). This process prevents the finish from being directional, facilitating a more effective pad and rotor break-in period, along with smooth, silent stopping power for the life of the rotors.

Oftentimes these phosphate coatings are only preventative during shipping and storage, resulting in immediate visible corrosion once exposed to heat and moisture on your vehicle. ECS's Electrostatic Coating is tested to endure 400 hours of salt spray exposure without rusting to save you the headache that comes from both the unappealing aesthetic of rusty rotors and associated run out issues. ECS V4 Rotors have a fully machined finish to promote superior rotor balance and to give your car an attractive rotor that peeks out from behind your beloved wheels. ECS's V4 Rotors are designed to have a double disc ground, taper free finish - this prevents run out through guaranteed parallelism and accurate disc thickness variation (DTV). This process prevents the finish from being directional, facilitating a more effective pad and rotor break-in period, along with smooth, silent stopping power for the life of the rotors. ECS V4 Slotted rotors will give your car track appeal, complimenting the rest of your wheel and suspension setup. Designed to prevent brake dust and debris buildup from inhibiting performance, slotted rotors give you a more consistent brake feel. ECS carefully controls the cooling rate during the manufacturing process to ensure that their slotted rotors meet or exceed tensile strength requirements.

Not content to offer BMW owners the standard cast iron brake disc, Centric and StopTech started from the ground up to offer a higher quality product than even what the original manufacturers were offering. High Carbon literally means the metallurgy has been specially formulated for use with European brake pad formulas to bring improved braking performance, resist rotor cracking, and reduced pad squeal. The Centric/Stoptech-exclusive E-Coating is electro-statically applied to the entire rotor (inside and out) to withstand premature corrosion. Then the friction surface is double-disc ground and the rotor is mill balanced with strict tolerances.

ECS V4 Rotors have a fully machined finish to promote superior rotor balance and to give your car an attractive rotor that peeks out from behind your beloved wheels. ECS's V4 Rotors are designed to have a double disc ground, taper free finish - this prevents run out through guaranteed parallelism and accurate disc thickness variation (DTV).

On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade. This is where Two-Piece Floating rotors start to shine. Two-Piece rotors were designed specifically for high-performance applications and are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Needless to say, we aren't a fan of our track days being cut short due to braking issues, so we decided to create our very own performance-oriented TrackSport Rotors! Our TrackSport rotors feature a full floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. Additionally, thanks to these rotor's inherent two-piece design and the included Aluminum rotor hats, these remove almost 20% of the rotational mass versus stock rotors.

Not content to offer BMW owners the standard cast iron brake disc, Centric and StopTech started from the ground up to offer a higher quality product than even what the original manufacturers were offering. High Carbon literally means the metallurgy has been specially formulated for use with European brake pad formulas to bring improved braking performance, resist rotor cracking, and reduced pad squeal. The Centric/Stoptech-exclusive E-Coating is electro-statically applied to the entire rotor (inside and out) to withstand premature corrosion. Then the friction surface is double-disc ground and the rotor is mill balanced with strict tolerances.

Oftentimes these phosphate coatings are only preventative during shipping and storage, resulting in immediate visible corrosion once exposed to heat and moisture on your vehicle. ECS's Electrostatic Coating is tested to endure 400 hours of salt spray exposure without rusting to save you the headache that comes from both the unappealing aesthetic of rusty rotors and associated run out issues. ECS V4 Rotors have a fully machined finish to promote superior rotor balance and to give your car an attractive rotor that peeks out from behind your beloved wheels. ECS's V4 Rotors are designed to have a double disc ground, taper free finish - this prevents run out through guaranteed parallelism and accurate disc thickness variation (DTV). This process prevents the finish from being directional, facilitating a more effective pad and rotor break-in period, along with smooth, silent stopping power for the life of the rotors. ECS V4 Cross Drilled and Slotted rotors will give your vehicle track appeal, complimenting the rest of your wheel and suspension setup. Slotted rotors are designed to prevent brake dust and debris buildup from inhibiting performance, giving you more consistent brake feel. Cross drilled rotors keep your braking system cooler, thus reducing brake fade. Combining both cross-drilled and slotted rotor types gives you more reliable performance whether you're in stop-and-go traffic or driving in wet road conditions. ECS Tuning carefully controls the cooling rate during the manufacturing process to ensure that the drilled and slotted rotors meet or exceed tensile strength requirements. Additionally, V4 Cross Drilled and Slotted Rotors are designed independently for the left and right side of your vehicle, ensuring that the drilled holes do not touch any cooling vanes.
