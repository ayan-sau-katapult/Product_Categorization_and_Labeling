They provide a solid performance boost with a low upfront cost. For an excellent 'bang for the buck' upgrade, the software and intake are a great choice (TMS Underdrive Pulleys would also be on that list).   Related Upgrades: We are often asked what would complement our software and intake packages. Within any Stage, we recommend our Underdrive Power Pulley Kits and a cat-back exhaust. The Power Pulley Kit will under-drive the alternator, water pump, and power steering pump. Under-driving means each component is moving slower which requires less power. The saved horsepower is put back to the engine where it transfers to power at the wheels. Power gains are typically 10 horsepower at the wheels.   We also recommend upgrading the cat-back muffler for slightly more performance, lighter weight, and a more-aggressive sound. Our favorite E36 M3 mufflers are the Supersprint, Borla, or Corsa exhausts. The Supersprint is the quietest and most like stock while the Corsa is the most aggressive (Borla being in the middle).

Related Upgrades: We are often asked what would complement our software and intake packages. Within any Stage, we recommend our Underdrive Power Pulley Kits. The Power Pulley Kit will under-drive the alternator, water pump, and power steering pump. Under-driving means each component is moving slower which requires less power. The saved horsepower is put back to the engine where it transfers to power at the wheels. Power gains are typically 10 horsepower at the wheels.   We also recommend upgrading the cat-back muffler for slightly more performance, lighter weight, and a more-aggressive sound. Our favorite E46 mufflers are the Supersprint, Borla, or Corsa exhausts. The Supersprint is the quietest and most like stock while the Corsa is the most aggressive (Borla being in the middle).

These headers are a bolt-on to the engine and stock catalytic converters on the E36 M3. Other headers have to be used as a system with additional exhaust sections required for fitment. Our headers bolt straight on using factory gaskets and hardware and make an excellent mid-range improvement in power.   The TMS Shorty Headers are manufactured in the USA and are CARB-certified. These headers are not cheap, knock-off pieces. They are 100% T-304 stainless steel with ceramic coating. The coating and the stainless steel are crucial for the efficient flow of exhaust gas through the header. Other versions use only mild steel. We have also taken the extra step of adding ports for the secondary air system, allowing your car to remain emissions-compliant.   Adding the M50 manifold produces huge power gains in the upper RPM. If you spend the majority of your time over 5000 RPM, you're going to love this kit. This Package includes nearly all of our most-popular street upgrades for the E36 M3: intake, cams, software, and complemented by the M50 manifold. This is a serious kit designed to make big power in the high-RPM. With the change in the manifold there is not much of a mid-range torque increase. The Conforti software keeps any torque loss to a minimum.       - Underdriving means each component is moving slower which requires less power. The saved horsepower is put back to the engine where it transfers to power at the wheels. Power gains are typically 10hp at the wheels.    - Borla or Corsa cat-back muffler for more performance, lighter weight, and a more-aggressive sound. Expect a gain of 5whp with either of these exhausts.         1996-1999 E36 M3 (manual transmission)",Starting at

Included in this Stage 3+ kit is our very own Turner S55 Performance Software, our Turner Motorsport Performance Intake, Active Autowerke's Performance Stainless Catless Downpipes, FTP Motorsport's Charge Pipe Kit, Turner Test Pipes, and the CSF Top Mount Charge-Air-Cooler. Our carbon fiber performance intake is designed to significantly outflow the stock intake, providing your engine with more air at all RPMs. FTP's charge pipes further boost airflow potential while increasing reliability by getting rid of the stock charge pipes that have been known to fail. The stock intercooler/charge-air-cooler is very limited in its cooling capacity. With more air becoming available from the intake, the need for a beefier cooler becomes apparent. CSF's Performance Top Mount Aluminum Charge-Air-Cooler is the perfect choice to keep intake temps as low as possible to keep the charged air cool and dense, improving power. Active's F8X downpipes are strategically engineered to virtually eliminate the immensely restrictive characteristics of the factory F80 M3 and F82 M4 downpipes – therefore reducing radiant heat and increasing performance. Our Turner M3/M4 Test Pipes delete the secondary cats for more sound and performance. With the Turner Test Pipes, we got just enough exhaust sound in the cabin without it being obnoxious or intrusive. We especially love the subtle bark this setup gives when letting off the throttle!

The parts in Stage 3 are what led us to build Performance Stages in the first place. The parts in Stage 3 are our most-popular performance upgrades for the E36 M3: intake, cams, and software. While Stages 1 and 2 focus mostly on making mid-range power, Stage 3 shifts the focus on the top end of the RPM. With the more aggressive camshafts, we boost power over 5000 RPM in addition to more mid-range thrust.   The aFe Euro intake is designed for a 3.5"" HFM and includes a heat shield to block warm air from the engine compartment. The aFe intake uses an oiled cotton air filter for maximum air flow and excellent filtration. The kit is supplied complete with heat shield, intake tube, sealing materials, hardware, and install instructions.   Just like in Stage 2, we use a Porsche HFM to work with the Siemens DME and special Turner Motorsport/Conforti software. This HFM reads airflow far more accurately than less-expensive other HFMs on the market. That extra metering allows us to fine-tune the software to make the engine more responsive, smoother, and produce more power! From Stage 2 we learned that the stock 3.2 fuel injectors were nearly maxed out so we specified ""24lb"" injectors for Stage 3.   Stage 3 is designed for street cars that see a lot of runs to redline and the extra power over 5000 RPM is useable. We have matched the Schrick cams with the larger HFM and Stage 3 software to produce excellent top-end gains and an improvement in the low range while using the stock S52 intake manifold. We prefer the Schrick camshafts because they have been bulletproof through all of our testing and development. This is the best of both worlds - low/mid-RPM muscle with much-improved top-end. We also supply this Package as the Stage 3+ which uses the M50 intake manifold. This provides a lot of top-end power but the expense of low-end torque.       - Underdriving means each component is moving slower which requires less power. The saved horsepower is put back to the engine where it transfers to power at the wheels. Power gains are typically 10hp at the wheels.    - Borla or Corsa cat-back muffler for more performance, lighter weight, and a more-aggressive sound. Expect a gain of 5whp with either of these exhausts.         1996-1999 E36 M3 (manual transmission)",

These headers are a bolt-on to the engine and stock catalytic converters on the E36 M3. Other headers have to be used as a system with additional exhaust sections required for fitment. Our headers bolt straight on using factory gaskets and hardware and make an excellent mid-range improvement in power.   The TMS Shorty Headers are manufactured in the USA and are CARB-certified. These headers are not cheap, knock-off pieces. They are 100% T-304 stainless steel with ceramic coating. The coating and the stainless steel are crucial for the efficient flow of exhaust gas through the header. Other versions use only mild steel. We have also taken the extra step of adding ports for the secondary air system, allowing your car to remain emissions-compliant.   As with Stage 3, this Package includes the aFe Euro Cold-Air Intake, 24lb fuel injectors, Schrick performance camshafts, Porsche HFM, and special Stage 4 TMS Shark Injector software. This is a further refinement to Stage 3 - boosting top end horsepower while still making more torque down low. Peak power and torque is increased over Stage 3 with significant torque improvements from 5000 RPM.       - Underdriving means each component is moving slower which requires less power. The saved horsepower is put back to the engine where it transfers to power at the wheels.

All of the following stages require the parts from Stage 2. In this Package we supply a aFe Euro Cold Air Intake, TMS 3.5"" HFM with adapter, ""24lb"" Bosch fuel injectors, associated installation hardware and instructions, and TMS-exclusive Stage 2 software (co-developed with Jim Conforti).   The aFe Euro intake is designed for a 3.5"" HFM and includes a heat shield to block warm air from the engine compartment. The aFe intake uses an oiled cotton air filter for maximum air flow and excellent filtration. The kit is supplied complete with heat shield, intake tube, sealing materials, hardware, and install instructions.   The HFM is 3.5 inches in diameter - a half-inch larger than the stock HFM. We selected the HFM from the Porsche 911 (993) because of its superior metering capability over the Euro M3 or 540 HFM. This HFM comes with a custom wiring harness for a seamless install and full compatibility with the Siemens DME and Conforit software. The beauty of this HFM is that it reads airflow far more accurately than less-expensive other HFMs on the market. Imagine the data stream on a strip of tape 3 feet long. A stock or Euro/540 HFM will read that data 50 times for the length of the tape. The Porsche HFM will read the same data 300 times in that same distance. That extra metering allows us to fine-tune the software to make the engine more responsive, smoother, and produce more power!   We found that the stock fuel injectors on the S52 engine were at their maximum capacity with the larger HFM and intake. To prevent dangerous lean conditions we spec'd out a larger set of Bosch fuel injectors (24lb/hour or 25.5lb at the BMW-spec 3.5bar of pressure). The software was recalibrated to match the larger fuel flow.   The rest of this Package is made up of a HFM adapter to work with the stock throttle body boot (Samco silicone boot optional), installation hardware, HFM wiring harness, and installation instructions. As a Package, installation time for the typical do-it-yourselfer would be 3-4 hours.       - Underdriving means each component is moving slower which requires less power.

This special package combines some of our most popular upgrades for a lot of horsepower and less money!!! It�s a great bolt-on first step for big power gains without having to go into the engine for cams or head work.   We use the aFe 'Euro' Intake Kit, Bosch Euro HFM, and a special Conforti-TMS Performance Chip. This package retains the 3.0�s stock 17lb injectors (green top). The aFe intake is made with heat-blocking materials, reducing underhood temperatures and not contributing to heat soak of the air filter. The aFe Intake uses an oiled cloth air filter for maximum air flow and excellent filtration.   With the undersized stock air sensor, the M3 is gasping for breath. But with the larger 3.5� Euro HFM and Euro Intake, the M3�s engine can breathe a lot better. This kit works on all M3s with the US S50 3.0-liter engine. It will also work on the S52 3.2 if OBD-1 17lb injectors are used.Our TMS Performance Chips were also developed by Jim Conforti and tuned specifically for the Euro HFM and aFe Intake. Our chips require premium fuel (91 or higher) and allow us to alter the settings on the engine management. Because we can be more aggressive in our tuning, we can get a lot of horsepower for very little money.   Related Upgrades: We are often asked what would complement our software and intake packages. Within any Stage, we recommend our Underdrive Power Pulley Kits and a cat-back exhaust. The Power Pulley Kit will under-drive the alternator, water pump, and power steering pump. Under-driving means each component is moving slower which requires less power. The saved horsepower is put back to the engine where it transfers to power at the wheels. Power gains are typically 10 horsepower at the wheels.   We also recommend upgrading the cat-back muffler for slightly more performance, lighter weight, and a more-aggressive sound. Our favorite E36 M3 mufflers are the Supersprint, Borla, or Corsa exhausts. The Supersprint is the quietest and most like stock while the Corsa is the most aggressive (Borla being in the middle). You can expect a gain of 5whp with any of these exhausts.       This kit is based on the 1995 M3's 17lb fuel injectors. If you have upgraded to 21.5lb injectors or are running a S52 3.2, see the Stage 1.5 Kit below. The 17lb injectors are barely adequate with the variable quality of fuel in the USA. Larger injectors are recommended to ensure enough high-quality octane to prevent knocking/detonation.     1994-1995    liter",Starting at

The 21.5lb injectors (23lb at BMW's 3.5 bar) were standard on the S52 3.2-liter engines. Because that engine has found its way into many other E36s, we put this kit together to use the Euro HFM, intake, and the stock 3.2 injectors. Also, it's been necessary for some people to add more fuel to account for cleaner-burning gasoline used in the US. With the lower grade fuel, pinging, knocking, or lean conditions may be experienced with the stock 3.0 injectors. The issues people are having seem to be geography-related (California, the Northeast, etc.) but many people feel safer having a fuel 'safety net' and this Package meets their goals. We also offer a Stage 2 Package with 24lb injectors if these are still not flowing enough fuel. There is no performance gain with only adding the 21.5lb injectors.   We use the aFe 'Euro' Intake Kit, Bosch Euro HFM, Bosch 21.5lb injectors, and a special TMS Stage 1.5 Performance Chip. The aFe intake is made with heat-blocking materials, reducing underhood emperatures and not contributing to heat soak of the air filter. The aFE intake uses an oiled cotton air filter for maximum air flow and excellent filtration.   With the undersized stock air sensor, the M3 is gasping for breath. But with the larger 3.5� Euro HFM and Euro Intake, the M3�s engine can breathe a lot better. This kit works on all 1995-1999 M3s with the US S50 3.0-liter or S52 3.2-liter engine (and using OBD-I engine computer).Our TMS Performance Chip is tuned specifically for the Euro HFM, aFe Intake, and 21.5lb injectors. Our chips require premium fuel (91 or higher) and allow us to alter the settings on the engine management.   Related Upgrades: We are often asked what would complement our software and intake packages. Within any Stage, we recommend our Underdrive Power Pulley Kits and a cat-back exhaust. The Power Pulley Kit will under-drive the alternator, water pump, and power steering pump. Under-driving means each component is moving slower which requires less power. The saved horsepower is put back to the engine where it transfers to power at the wheels. Power gains are typically 10 horsepower at the wheels.   We also recommend upgrading the cat-back muffler for slightly more performance, lighter weight, and a more-aggressive sound. Our favorite E36 M3 mufflers are the Supersprint, Borla, or Corsa exhausts. The Supersprint is the quietest and most like stock while the Corsa is the most aggressive (Borla being in the middle). You can expect a gain of 5whp with any of these exhausts.         aFe 'Euro' Cold Air Intake (filter, heat shield, intake tube)  Bosch Euro M3 HFM  HFM adapter  TMS Performance Chip (we need your car's production date, choose from below)          1995 E36 M3 3.0 (21.5lb injectors required) (manual transmission only)  1996-99 E36 M3 3.2 (manual transmission only)    any S50 or S52 with OBD-1 in an E36 (330i, 332i, 332ti, etc)",Starting at
