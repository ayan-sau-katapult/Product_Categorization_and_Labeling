Eventuri is the gold standard for carbon fiber performance upgrades, and these chargepipes are no exception. The three main criteria kept in mind during the design of these chargepipes was fitment, flow quality, and strength. The carbon fiber construction allows for complex geometry providing an OE like fit. The flow is increased over stock, sporting a constant diameter throughout the chargepipes. The strength of OEM chargepipes is poor, rendering them prone to failure. The cross-directional carbon weave on the Eventuri pipes are over 2mm thick, providing a reliable strength even with increased boost levels or larger turbos altogether."

This upgrade replaces the small hose on the hot side of the turbo outlet to the intercooler, and the long hose on the cold side from the intercooler to the charge pipe. This hose upgrade has a full 3"" construction, and when combined with their 3"" charge pipes increases the diameter that air has to travel through by 50 percent! Highlights: Faster Spool Increased Overall Airflow Direct Fit Constructed with 5 layers of extra-durable, high-temperature silicone, the ARM FMIC Hose Upgrade has been tested to hold over 30psi. Whether you're running a stock turbo N54 or N55 at 22psi or even upgraded turbo/s at 27psi, the ARM FMIC Hose upgrade is able to withstand even the most demanding applications. In addition to the the size and durability of the hoses, one of the biggest improvements you will see with the ARM FMIC hose upgrade is the single-piece construction on both sides of the intercooler. This will give the charged air flowing from the turbo/s in your N54 or N55 powered BMW one uninterrupted pathway from the turbos to the intercooler and from the intercooler to the charge pipe. Being constructed of a single piece minimizes the turbulence caused by connection points between hoses and piping. Combined with our N54/N55 Charge Pipe Upgrade, your BMW will have full 3” piping from the intercooler cold side all the way to the throttle body. The hot-side hose is sized at 2.5” to match up with the OEM turbo outlet size and expands to 3.25” ID to fit up to the ARM FMIC. The cold-side hose is also 3.25” at the intercooler and reduces slightly to a 3” ID which is maintained all the way to the charge pipe. With the ARM cold-side hose being one solid piece, it removes two connections in the middle of piping found on most other N54/N55 intercooler piping upgrades. Every connection brings with it a small disruption in airflow, the severity of the turbulence varying depending on the characteristics of the connection. Removing these extra connections in the intercooler piping system improves the transition of air flowing from the intercooler to the charge pipe. **NOTE** This upgrade requires the use of ARM's 5"" or 7"" Front Mount Intercooler as well as their N55 or N54 Charge Pipe."

Additional boost can overwhelm the stock BMW diverter valve system and lead to boost leakage, or boost spikes, and lost horsepower. With the factory components in place it's hard to    consistently high boost levels. Instead of the weak plastic components of the stock system, Active Autowerke uses a CNC-machined and mandrel-bent aluminum tube with a Venturi blow-off valve in place of the original diverter valves. The blow-off valve dumps overboost into the atmosphere for that distinctive turbo 'whoosh' sound. The single AA BOV is over-sized for the N54 application - taking the place of the two small diverter valves, and verified to handle over 600hp. With the BOV acting properly your turbos and other components are protected from compressor surge caused by excess pressure build-up.   We like the Active BOV better than other forms of diverter and BOV kits because it's tried and true - AA was the original turbo BMW tuners and their experience is second to none. That's why they took the time to engineer their kit to fit perfectly, using the OE-type connector to the throttle body, and high-strength silicone to the lower intercooler tube. Each connection is a tight, leak-free seal. The kit comes complete with the discharge tube, vacuum plugs for the stock hoses, and instructions. The tube is powdercoated in black and with a wrinkle finish for an OE appearance.     2008-2010    135i 1M  2007-2010    335i 335xi 335i xDrive  2007-2010    335i 335is 335xi 335i xDrive  2007-2010    335i"

The original N55 charge pipe is made from a weak plastic and can fail with even stock boost levels. The most common problem is a crack that develops along a seam where the pipe connects to the throttle body. Any crack here is bad as it creates a massive vacuum leak and the engine electronics will put the car into limp mode. If you don't want to be sidelined there is a very simple fix - the Active Autowerke N55 charge pipe.   This aluminum pipe is much stronger and more durable and nearly indestructable for the N55 application. It uses a CNC-machined factory-style connection and o-ring to the throttle body to ensure a tight and leak-free seal. The piping is a consistent 3"" diameter for better flow and an improved throttle response. AA has included a raised boss with two ports should you choose to add a water/meth injection system later. The factory MAP sensor installs in the same location and the pipe is powdercoated black for a factory-type appearance.   With a stronger pipe you don't have to worry about the infamous chargepipe crack and lost boost levels and horsepower. All of the boost in the world is useless if it's leaking so using beefed up components in place of the weak factory pieces is the smart way to    high power output.     2011-2012    135i  2011    335i 335xi 335i xDrive - Sedan  2011-2013    335i 335is 335xi 335i xDrive - Coupe  2011-2013    335i - Convertible"

The BOV is higher quality than the diverter valves and will exit intake air to the outside instead of putting it back through the turbo system (which will reduce strain on the turbos).

Relocating the inlets on your N54 with the ARM Inlets increase the power and torque of your N54 up to 60whp/60wtq. Expect improved turbo spool, faster peak boost, and more volume from the turbochargers on your N54. If you're looking to max out your stock or upgraded twin turbochargers these are a must! Highlights: Gains of up to 60whp/60wtq Quicker Turbo Spool Increased Turbo Volume One of the greatest challenges when upgrading to relocated inlets on your N54 is mitigating the heat of the air induced by the turbos. With the inlets relocated to the passenger-side the filters are closer to the turbochargers where temperatures are hotter. The ARM N54 Inlets come with a manifold heat shield which serves to help keep heat down near the turbos and away from the inlet filters. This also assists with keeping heat away from the inlet tubes themselves. In addition, the ARM Inlets come with an air filter heat shield which assists in keeping the cooler air near the filters separate from hotter air coming from the engine adjacent to it. The air filters on the ARM Inlets are secured in place with a filter bracket which prevents filters and inlets themselves from bouncing around during acceleration, braking, and cornering. Also included with the ARM Inlets is a support bracket for the boost solenoids. This keeps them locked into place during extreme driving. To help make installation easy, relocation brackets for the coolant reservoir and power steering pump reservoir are included with the ARM Inlets.

We invested many hours of testing and fitting this kit to get the best fitment, and highest quality. We are very happy with the results. Full disclosure, the factory intake system as far as the airbox is very good, but the intake tract down to the turbo, is full of twists turns, bellows, etc which can cause flow disruption. It also has a silencer which is a restriction as it bypasses air to quiet the intake sound. By removing all of these, and replacing them with our 3'-3.5' Silicone intake tube either to our 6' cone filter or the stock airbox you are removing all of those, and providing a free-flowing optimized air path from the filter or airbox to the turbo. From our testing we found up to 700WHP, the stock airbox is up to the task if stock appearance and sound is what you wish. Once you go over 700WHP, we suggest stepping up to the 6' cone with a built-in velocity stack."

Relocating the inlets on your N54 with the ARM Inlets increase the power and torque of your N54 up to 60whp/60wtq. Expect improved turbo spool, faster peak boost, and more volume from the turbochargers on your N54. If you're looking to max out your stock or upgraded twin turbochargers these are a must! Highlights: Gains of up to 60whp/60wtq Quicker Turbo Spool Increased Turbo Volume One of the greatest challenges when upgrading to relocated inlets on your N54 is mitigating the heat of the air induced by the turbos. With the inlets relocated to the passenger-side the filters are closer to the turbochargers where temperatures are hotter. The ARM N54 Inlets come with a manifold heat shield which serves to help keep heat down near the turbos and away from the inlet filters. This also assists with keeping heat away from the inlet tubes themselves. In addition, the ARM Inlets come with an air filter heat shield which assists in keeping the cooler air near the filters separate from hotter air coming from the engine adjacent to it. The air filters on the ARM Inlets are secured in place with a filter bracket which prevents filters and inlets themselves from bouncing around during acceleration, braking, and cornering. Also included with the ARM Inlets is a support bracket for the boost solenoids. This keeps them locked into place during extreme driving. To help make installation easy, relocation brackets for the coolant reservoir and power steering pump reservoir are included with the ARM Inlets.

While this is great for the production line and the sticker price, it doesn't hold up well as the engine ages or in the case of increased power. Replacing the weak plastic stock part with a solid aluminum one like this will ensure proper functionality under higher levels of boost and eliminate wear caused by the heating and cooling of plastic pipes. This charge pipe from FTP motorsports will not only improve flow over stock but also make a big improvement in the reliability column. Smooth radius bends allow for the cleanest path for air to travel as well as increased diameter which allows a larger volume of compressed air to be ingested. Additionally, an pre-machined meth bung allows for the addition of this system at the point of installation or at a later date. Features: Smooth bends for unobstructed flow Direct OEM replacement Larger than stock diameter for increased charge-air volume 3-Ply silicon couplers Machined bung for meth injection"

These can and will break at the plastic seams - adding this Active Autowerke charge pipe to your vehicle prevents the imminent vacuum leak stemming from a cracked factory charge pipe. This mod prevents your car from experiencing limp mode. Made from all aluminum, with a CNC machined connection to the throttle body, allowing for a tight seal. A boss with two separate ports are provided upstream where the injected mix of water/methanol can properly atomize before entering the engine. The thread depths for the water/metahnol nozzles are also checked to allow for a proper spray pattern without hitting the inside walls of the threaded holes. The BMW N55 engine does not utilize external diverter valves like it's N54 predecessor. Rather, the BMW N55 has diverter valves that are built inside the engine turbo compressor housings and no in the charge pipe.  As such, there are no provisions to add larger BOVs."
