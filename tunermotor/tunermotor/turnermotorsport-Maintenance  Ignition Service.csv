Colder spark plugs work by pulling more heat out of the engine's cylinders (making them ""colder"") and dissipating it into the engine's head, which is then cooled by the cooling system. Depending on how you have your engine built, these could be a great addition! Colder plugs can help prevent engine knock and prevent the tip of the spark plug from melting or misfiring. There are two rules that most people tend to go by when deciding on which spark plugs to buy: The first rule of thumb is that with every 100 horsepower added, you should run spark plugs that are a step colder than your stock plugs. This is generally accepted across the motorsports community but unfortunately isn't always the most accurate measurement of when you will need colder plugs. The second rule is to go a step colder any time you massively alter cylinder temperatures by adding forced induction to an NA engine, by increasing compression ratio, after altering timing in a major way, or by changing fuel types to something with a higher octane rating such as racing fuel. Adding spark plugs that are a step colder outside of these conditions, with no real change to the engine, can actually hurt more than help by leading to spark plugs fouling quicker than normal and by making the car harder to start in cold weather conditions. We suggest talking to your engine builder or tuner before making the change, or you can call our Turner Motorsport sales staff to discuss what modifications have been made to your vehicle and see if these plugs are right for you!"

With a faulty coil the spark plug is not burning the air/fuel mixture properly and that can lead to problems anywhere in the engine and exhaust (including catalytic converters and O2 sensors). Problems with one or more coils will cause a fault code but not always a check engine light. A misfire code may be related to an ignition coil but could be from other things as well. Sometimes a visual inspection of a coil and coil boot will give an indication of a failure. You can also move coils around to different cylinder banks to see if the misfire code follows a suspect coil. We suggest always having one or two coils on hand to keep as spares.This is the OEM Bosch ignition coil for the N52 engine used in cars up to 4/2006 production date.

Sometimes a visual inspection of a coil and coil boot will give an indication of a failure. You can also move coils around to different cylinder banks to see if the misfire code follows a suspect coil. We suggest always having one or two coils on hand to keep as spares.

Brisk Racing offers a great performance spark plug that gives you a more intense spark without sacrificing OEM reliability. The combination of a center electrode with Iridium contact and ground electrode from Yttrium alloy with copper core cut to spark plug center decreases demand for voltage, it opens the spark gap into the combustion chamber and significantly suppresses flame extinguishing effect at cold starts. In so doing the spark plugs change interval 65,000 miles is maintained. The material used to the spark plugs has a major impact on lifetime and functional properties. While precious metals such as Platinum and Iridium are very resistant to wear but have a considerable demand for high voltage generated by the ignition system. The combination of Iridium center electrode and ground electrodes of special design with Yttrium alloy which is based on Nickel is an ideal solution for maintaining lifetime and spark plug performance improvements. The requirement for power generated by the ignition system is also influenced by the geometric shape of the spark gap. Optimal combination of the spark gap and the reduced demand for form by appropriate choice of electrode material effect synergic on the improvement of spark plug performance.

With a faulty coil the spark plug is not burning the air/fuel mixture properly and that can lead to problems anywhere in the engine and exhaust (including catalytic converters and O2 sensors). Problems with one or more coils will cause a fault code but not always a check engine light. A misfire code may be related to an ignition coil but could be from other things as well. Sometimes a visual inspection of a coil and coil boot will give an indication of a failure. You can also move coils around to different cylinder banks to see if the misfire code follows a suspect coil. We suggest always having one or two coils on hand to keep as spares.

Problems with one or more coils will cause a fault code but not always a check engine light. A misfire code may be related to an ignition coil but could be from other things as well. Sometimes a visual inspection of a coil and coil boot will give an indication of a failure. You can also move coils around to different cylinder banks to see if the misfire code follows a suspect coil. We suggest always having one or two coils on hand to keep as spares.   Sold per coil.

Colder spark plugs work by pulling more heat out of the engine's cylinders (making them ""colder"") and dissipating it into the engine's head, which is then cooled by the cooling system. Depending on how you have your engine built, these could be a great addition! Colder plugs can help prevent engine knock and prevent the tip of the spark plug from melting or misfiring. There are two rules that most people tend to go by when deciding on which spark plugs to buy: The first rule of thumb is that with every 100 horsepower added, you should run spark plugs that are a step colder than your stock plugs. This is generally accepted across the motorsports community but unfortunately isn't always the most accurate measurement of when you will need colder plugs. The second rule is to go a step colder any time you massively alter cylinder temperatures by adding forced induction to an NA engine, by increasing compression ratio, after altering timing in a major way, or by changing fuel types to something with a higher octane rating such as racing fuel. Adding spark plugs that are a step colder outside of these conditions, with no real change to the engine, can actually hurt more than help by leading to spark plugs fouling quicker than normal and by making the car harder to start in cold weather conditions.
