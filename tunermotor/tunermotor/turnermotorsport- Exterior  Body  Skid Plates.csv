The issue some of the vehicle owners have experienced is road debris from small branches to chunks of ice have impacted the OE belly pan hard enough to crack the oil cooler draining the cars oil rapidly. Being one of the lowest points of the car, even a close encounter with a parking block can mean the end of the road for the factory belly pan - and oil cooler. Damage to the belly pan means reduced cooling, which can result in dangerously high engine temperatures. Once the belly pan is damaged, there is no longer any protection for the oil cooler, meaning damage to the cooler and a catastrophic loss in oil pressure may be right around the corner."

Even in a road course environment with extremely high ambient temperatures, the S55 engine tends to operate beautifully, with consistent oil and water temperatures. Although excellent ducting, good core design, strong fans, and other factors all play in to how well a cooling system works, there are ultimately two factors which cannot be circumvented—you must have enough heat exchanger surface area, and you must have enough heat exchangers. These constraints have left the S55 with a “fatal flaw”—the engine’s oil cooler is precariously exposed. A direct impact to the oil cooler can have catastrophic effects, draining the S55 of all of its oil in seconds, a dire fate that several owners have experienced in a painfully direct way. In response to this, Fall-Line Motorsports has developed a robust oil cooler guard, specifically designed to shield the S55’s oil cooler from large road debris and prevent much more costly damage. For the best real-world protection, the S55 oil cooler guard is constructed from a thick stainless steel plate and fastens directly to existing frame members to help spread the impact load across strong structural components. As an acknowledgement of BMW M’s aforementioned air flow engineering, special care was taken to ensure that the opening in the oil cooler guard matched the shape and size of the existing BMW oil cooler air outlet. Installation hardware is included. MADE IN THE USA."

Although excellent ducting, good core design, strong fans, and other factors all play into how well a cooling system works, there is one ultimate factor which cannot be circumvented- you must have enough heat exchanger surface area, and you must have enough heat exchangers. When examining the front of an M5 then, we see the hard work of the M engineers in packaging the various cooling components of the car. Everything had to be accounted for, and given ample space, surface area, and ducting. Unfortunately, this leaves the S63 engine’s oil cooler precariously exposed. A direct impact to the oil cooler can have catastrophic effects, draining the S63 of all of its oil in seconds, a fact that more than a handful M5 owners have had to learn in a painfully direct way. Having seen that this was a critical need for the F90 M5 cars, IND worked with Fall Line Motorsports to develop a robust oil cooler guard, specifically designed to shield the S63’s oil cooler from large road debris and prevent disaster. The new Fall Line Motorsports oil cooler guards will be constructed from a thick stainless steel plate and will fasten directly to existing frame members on the F90 M5 cars, spreading any impact across strong structural components. Special care was taken to ensure that the opening in the oil cooler guard matched the shape and size of the existing BMW oil cooler air outlet, ensuring that proper air flow is maintained. Installation is straightforward and uses all existing mounting locations, and also retains the factory BMW plastic shield and associated outlet ducting. Installation hardware is included. MADE IN THE USA."

When the vehicles are lowered, they also become vulnerable to damage when bottoming out on high spots in the road, drive ways, and other business entrances. This can pose a serious problem if the oil pan and other sensitive components are damaged when this happens. Cracks in the oil pan could result in a destroyed motor if the oil is allowed to completely leak out and any number of bushings, steering components, or exposed fluid lines could easily be ripped out of place, compromising the safety and control of the vehicle."
