Joint rubber deteriorates over time from torque stress and heat hardening. A failed joint is a common cause of driveline noise and vibration. This joint should be inspected during normal maintenance for signs of heat cracking and tears in the rubber. Failed joints should be replaced before they cause additional damage and expense or disable the vehicle."
