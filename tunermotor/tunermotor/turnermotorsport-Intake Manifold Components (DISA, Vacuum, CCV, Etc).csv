We see crankcase vent issues on even stock engines but with more boost the problems are exponential. This Vargas upgraded PCV valve, and an oil catch can, are what the N54 engine needs and may alleviate most of your oil and boost leak issues. The PCV valve is supposed to let oil either return to the oil pan or pass through the intake manifold and get burned up in the combustion chamber. However, BMW used a weak plastic vent valve that doesn't seal well when under boost. Instead of  closing and venting the oil out of the intake, it's forced through this valve and into the intake and coating your valves with oil residue and carbon. Most boost equals more oil forcing its way by. This upgraded N54 PCV valve uses higher grade materials, including aluminum, to provide a better seal and prevent oil from entering the intake. It's an easy install and a must-have item when considering any turbo work."

What this means is that when the turbochargers are making boost, pressurized air can become forced backwards through the valve and back into the crankcase. Depending on the condition of your PCV valve this can range from irritating to dangerous as a pressurized case can cause all sorts of issues. Additionally, if your valve cover is cracked due to age or has a bad gasket you are more than likely experiencing a pressure leak either internally or externally. These two features can cause even a low-mileage N54 to run like a tired elephant, sometimes even unlocking a special bonus function known as ""Limp Mode"". The solution is to replace any failed components and upgrade the PCV valve to something more capable withstanding the abuse of a turbocharged environment. FTP Motorsport has you covered with this solid aluminum valve assembly. It is essentially the same thing that came in your car from the factory, made out of aluminum. The internal components have also been made to fit tighter and outlast the life of an off the shelf replacement. No, this won't be the very last PCV valve you buy, but it will most certainly alleviate a lot of headaches common to N54 owners. And if you're tuned, big twin or single swapped you need one of these yesterday."

Stalling? Sputtering? These are all symptoms of poor fuel delivery or a vacuum leak in your intake system. The idle control valve is one of the areas that you can check to fix these issues. The ICV is basically a electrically-driven throttle body that regulates the air/fuel mixture at light throttle openings. Over time, the ICV can become gummed up with oil and carbon, resulting in slow or blocked operation. Worst case, the electric motor inside will freeze which will stall the engine.The ICV will typically need to be cleaned or replaced every 100k miles. It can be cleaned with carb cleaner but for seriously dirty or old ICVs you may want to replace the whole unit with a new one. There is also a hard rubber seal between the ICV and the manifold and this should be replaced as well. You may also want to replace the Crankcase Vent Valve as it can also fill up with oil and carbon and replacement can be done at the same time as the ICV.Add a new Bosch ICV to your M50 Manifold Upgrade to save time and money!This is a new OEM Bosch idle control valve.

The 330i used BMW's 'high output' N52 engine with a stock 255hp. The other cars used a very similar 3.0-liter engine with only minor changes. The biggest change was with the intake manifold. While these other cars used a single-stage intake manifold, the 330 came with a more advanced 3-stage manifold with electronic valves to direct air to the cylinders that need it most. This kit is a straight-forward bolt-on replacement of your stock manifold.     The 330 manifold uses two electronic DISA valves (Differential Air Control) to direct incoming air to the cylinders that need it most. The system works based on RPM range to fill each cylinder with as much air as possible while the intake valves are open. This is done by diverting air away from cylinders that have their intake valves closed. With more air volume and fuel adjustments you can extract more power from those cylinders at any given RPM. The standard and medium output N52 engines make do with the old-fashioned single stage system that only works to boost torque in the mid-range. With the additional DISA system you can extract much more power, especially at high RPM. We did our first development on this system in 2006 and it has been one of our top N52 performance upgrades ever since."

The ICV is basically a electrically-driven throttle body that regulates the air/fuel mixture at light throttle openings. Over time, the ICV can become gummed up with oil and carbon, resulting in slow or blocked operation. Worst case, the electric motor inside will freeze which will stall the engine.The ICV will typically need to be cleaned or replaced every 100k miles. It can be cleaned with carb cleaner but for seriously dirty or old ICVs you may want to replace the whole unit with a new one.

It's the same type of system previously known as a PCV valve and the same deficiencies exist. Over time, the CVV will become saturated and clogged with oil. When this happens, the oil-rich vapors from the engine will back up into the intake tract and eventually into the combustion chamber. The oil added to the gasoline/air mix will cause misfires, carbon deposits, rough running, and blue smoke out the tailpipe.

Made from 100% high-grade prepreg carbon, including the internal trumpets, this plenum replaces the stock plastic version and unleashes the roar of the naturally aspirated BMW V8 engine. Since the trumpet lengths are tuned by BMW to the internal volume, changing this could result in a loss of performance, so Eventuri kept the same volume to not upset the way the car drives in terms of power delivery. Although there isn’t a performance gain from the carbon plenum, the induction sound generated takes the driving experience of the M3 to a whole new level. The raw V8 rumble gives the M3 an almost CSL like sound and is a truly intoxicating experience. Eventuri went through several iterations using different carbon thicknesses to fine-tune the sound, and the resulting plenum generates an almost unbelievable induction volume and tone."

The 330i used BMW's 'high output' N52 engine with a stock 255hp. The other cars used a very similar 3.0-liter engine with only minor changes. The biggest change was with the intake manifold. While these other cars used a single-stage intake manifold, the 330 came with a more advanced 3-stage manifold with electronic valves to direct air to the cylinders that need it most. This kit is a straight-forward bolt-on       The 330 manifold uses two electronic DISA valves (Differential Air Control) to direct incoming air to the cylinders that need it most. The system works based on RPM range to fill each cylinder with as much air as possible while the intake valves are open. This is done by diverting air away from cylinders that have their intake valves closed. With more air volume and fuel adjustments you can extract more power from those cylinders at any given RPM. The standard and medium output N52 engines make do with the old-fashioned single stage system that only works to boost torque in the mid-range. With the additional DISA system you can extract much more power, especially at high RPM. We did our first development on this system in 2006 and it has been one of our top N52 performance upgrades ever since."

Under ideal circumstances, the oil vapor would pass back into the intake and get burned up during normal combustion. The liquid oil would follow a path back down into the oil pan and be reused. This system is environmentally friendly but plagued with problems. The heating elements can fail or solid oil and carbon particles can block the oil separator valve. With no escape, the oil will continue to pool and collect in the valve cover or make its way into the combustion chamber leading to excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, idle and running issues. These issues are worse in colder climates where the freezing temperatures create a oil sludge condition that is impossible to clear. Thankfully, the CCV is replaceable on the early N52 engines (2006) and should be inspected during a major service and any time the valve cover is off. Oil can also back up into the throttle body, which is easier to check than the oil separator itself. Later N52 engines do not have a serviceable oil vent as it is integrated into the valve cover and not a separate part.   The oil separator can be replaced on its own but for a complete service we also recommend replacing the oil separator hoses and cleaning the valve cover. Any valve cover or intake manifold work should include a new oil separator valve.     2006-2011    325i 325xi 330i 330xi - Sedan  2006-2012    325xi - Wagon  2006-2007    525i 525xi 530i 530xi  2006-2008    Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si"

The newer 2nd gen B58 engine, found in the Mk5 Supra, has already been proven to be an incredible platform for performance enthusiasts – taking the performance and motorsports industry by storm in just a couple of years since its release. In a short amount of time, performance enthusiasts have already started to more than double the stock engine output – now pushing through 700whp, 800whp, and looking into the elusive 4 digit 1,000whp mark. The OEM water-cooled charge air cooler intake manifold for the B58 engine is adequate in cars with little or no modifications, but starts to really show an apparent weakness in cars that have bolt-on modifications, turbo upgrades, increased fueling (such as port injection), and performance tuning. Also, the OEM intercooler system has been known to suffer from heat soak in demanding racing conditions such as time attack, endurance racing, drag racing, and drifting, as well as spirited driving on the street. This can cause the car to pull timing out of the engine due to high intake air temperatures (IATs), and then can cause “limp mode” once temperatures reach a certain threshold, as the vehicle’s ECU will cut power to protect the engine. CSF conducted extensive testing on the dyno with R&D partner VF Engineering to ensure performance improvements before going into production with the new manifold. CSF performed over 50 dyno runs on the same car, on the same day, in relatively hot ambient conditions (~90°F) comparing the performance of the CSF Charge-Air Cooler Manifold to the OEM. Both the CSF and OEM cooler went through roughly 25 back-to-back dyno pulls every 30 seconds to measure the performance of the car overtime, resistance to heat soak, recovery time, and the effect on the turbo system duty cycle."

Under ideal circumstances, the oil vapor would pass back into the intake and get burned up during normal combustion. The liquid oil would follow a path back down into the oil pan and be reused. This system is environmentally friendly but plagued with problems. The heating elements can fail or oil and carbon particles can block the oil separator valve. With no escape, the oil will continue to pool and collect in the valve cover or make its way into the combustion chamber leading to excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, idle and running issues. These issues are worse in colder climates where the freezing temperatures create an oil sludge condition that is impossible to clear. The plastic hoses can become brittle and crack which leads to vacuum leaks and oil leaks. Thankfully, the CCV is replaceable on the early N52 engines (2006 and some 2007 models) and should be inspected during a major service and any time the valve cover is off. Oil can also back up into the throttle body, which is easier to check than the oil separator itself. Later N52 engines do not have a serviceable oil vent as it is integrated into the valve cover and not a separate part.   This is a kit containing the oil separator, the vent hoses, and the intake manifold gaskets that are done during a typical oil separator replacement. Complete kit includes:"
