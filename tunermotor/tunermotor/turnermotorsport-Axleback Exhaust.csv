You can pick and choose from either a 60mm Exhaust manifold, designed for increased exhaust flow and higher power potential, or a 63.5mm Racing Exhaust Manifold, built entirely for the best exhaust flow possible! To accompany the headers, you again have the choice of either a catted Section 1 exhaust pipes that feature high-flow metallic catalytic converters, keeping emissions down, or straight Section 1 pipes that eliminate the secondary catalytic converters, eliminating unnecessary exhaust restrictions. Available either as a part of a full system or by itself, the Supersprint Section 2 X-Pipe is the perfect replacement for the factory x-pipe that is resonated and adds another point of excessive restriction and muffling. The Supersprint X-pipe has a straight-through design that provides better flow characteristics and gives your BMW a slightly more aggressive exhaust note. The last set of exhaust components available are the Mufflers and the optional connecting kit. Available in two versions, Sport or Race, Supersprint mufflers are designed with power in mind, while still giving amazing exhaust tones! The Sport mufflers are slightly louder than stock and flow much better than the stock mufflers, and the Race mufflers are even louder and more free-flowing, giving your Z4 M an amazing exhaust sound that never gets old! If you want to run only the mufflers and not any of the other components, you must also purchase the connecting kit which allows you to pair the mufflers with your stock x-pipe. If you decide to go with the Supersprint X-pipe, the connecting kit is not needed.

We love our M6 but it's just too quiet so we looked at ways to get more of the stock exhaust to be heard. After evaluating the stock exhaust layout it was easy to see that removing the rear mufflers would accomplish what we wanted. But cutting the mufflers off is just the beginning. We then had to develop a set of pipes and design a set of tips that fit perfectly and also looked right at home on the Coupe and Gran Coupe. Our Race Inspired Exhaust is the finished product.Our axle-back exhaust is made from a 304 stainless steel tube in the same diameter as the stock exhaust and with mandrel bends for unimpeded flow. It fits with the stock hangers and is clamped to the stock exhaust pipes once the factory mufflers are cut off. The entire installation can be done in about an hour with the exhaust on the car. With factory BMW clamps, available from us as well, you can easily re-install your stock mufflers at any time. Our tips are also stainless in a perfectly proportioned 102mm (4.0"" diameter). They fill out the rear bumper valence perfectly - not too small like stock and not boy-racer large. Tips are available in polished silver or satin black. We have designed our tips to fit both the standard coupe and Gran Coupe bumpers.The final result is that removing the stock mufflers really lets the M6 V8 sing! With the mufflers and flapper valves removed the sound on start-up is scintillating. The sound from the S63TU engine is robust and intoxicating - it just needs to be heard! From outside, the muffler-delete exhaust makes the car seem all the more impressive. From the burble at idle to the roar under full throttle there is little doubt that this is a proper M car. Inside the car during normal driving the sound is not changed much thanks to the Active Sound Design system. It's a little louder but not intrusive or irritating. Around town the car sounds much like stock but just a touch louder and deeper. The exhaust pops and burbles more with each downshift, especially in Sport Plus Mode. On the highway at 70-80 cruising speeds it sounds similar to the stock exhaust. As far as ""drone"" goes-- we only experienced a slight drone at very low speeds in a high gear (i.e. - lugging the engine) which we normally wouldn't do. If you purchase this system and it's simply too loud for your neighbors or wife's taste, we have the simple solution. We sell resonators that bolt in place, knocking the volume down by approximately 50%.Our Race Inspired M6 exhaust is perfect for enhancing and accentuating the stock sound. It lets more of the M6's soundtrack come through without extensive exhaust modifications. If you want to enjoy the M6's sound more, think of this as its volume knob turned up.",Starting at

This is a sport exhaust that you can live with on a daily basis but it opens up when you get on it.

This gives you nearly all of the sweet Corsa sound but a more accessible price point. Tips are available as polished or black and laser engraved with the Corsa logo. The black tips have an innovative coating that won't chip or flake and provides outstanding corrosion resistance.   Although known as the Twin Silencer Exhaust (TSE3) this system almost has dual personalities. When driven aggressively it produces a throaty and charismatic exhaust note. It has plenty of burbles and pops that a performance exhaust should have and compliments other performance upgrades you may have on your car. But when driven lightly there's only a slight hint of sporty sound. It becomes a subdued version of its other self and completely livable on daily and highway trips with NO DRONE! You can use it on a daily driver without it being annoying or intrusive and then let it off its leash for the weekend fun runs.   Reflective Sound-Cancellation (RSC) technology - This feature is a patented non-electrical noise control system, where engine sound (pressure) waves are reflected in passages inside the muffler 180 degrees out of phase to cancel out unwanted sound waves. The result is a tuned muffler that ""cleans up"" the noise without eliminating the pure sound of power associated with a high-performance vehicle. Using the Corsa technology, the stainless steel mufflers are tuned to eliminate passenger cabin resonance and produce just the ""right"" sound. The result is quieter cruising with an awe-inspiring roar at full throttle. This system is amazingly quiet during normal cruising, due to the ""no drone"" RSC technology, yet still has an aggressive presence and full sound while under throttle. This makes for ideal sound for those that want an aggressive ""roar"" while driving hard, yet still want a more discrete lower volume for normal cruising.   This is an axle-back system, which replaces only the rear mufflers of the stock 325/330 exhaust. It's very easy and straightforward to install and the rest of the exhaust can remain on the car (the original muffler is cut from the exhaust). Detailed photographic instructions are included. This system is 100% Made in the USA and carries a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. This exhaust is emissions legal in all 50 states (no effect whatsoever on emissions, and no ""Check Engine"" warning lights).               2001-2006    325i 325ci 330i 330ci",Starting at
