Other cars use a blow-off valve to vent the pressurized air into the atmosphere (the whoosh sound commonly heard on turbo engines) but BMW and other makers use a diverter valve to keep the air circulating through the intake for emissions purposes. A failing diverter valve will lead to a boost leak as turbocharged air leaks past the seals instead of going into the engine when you want it. This is a minor issue on stock engines but a bigger issue on tuned or heavily modded engines (those will use an aluminum diverter valve instead of the stock plastic). The factory diverter valve is plastic which is prone to cracking and electric which will fail without warning. This is a direct replacement diverter valve for cars with the N55 and S63 (X5M/X6M) engines.

  ...",4416,AABOVKIT-N54,$565.25,"When adding boost to the N54 engine, it's important to consider effects throughout the rest of the system. Additional boost can overwhelm the stock BMW diverter valve system and lead to boost leakage, or boost spikes, and lost horsepower. With the factory components in place it's hard to    consistently high boost levels. Instead of the weak plastic components of the stock system, Active Autowerke uses a CNC-machined and mandrel-bent aluminum tube with a Venturi blow-off valve in place of the original diverter valves. The blow-off valve dumps overboost into the atmosphere for that distinctive turbo 'whoosh' sound. The single AA BOV is over-sized for the N54 application - taking the place of the two small diverter valves, and verified to handle over 600hp. With the BOV acting properly your turbos and other components are protected from compressor surge caused by excess pressure build-up.   We like the Active BOV better than other forms of diverter and BOV kits because it's tried and true - AA was the original turbo BMW tuners and their experience is second to none. That's why they took the time to engineer their kit to fit perfectly, using the OE-type connector to the throttle body, and high-strength silicone to the lower intercooler tube. Each connection is a tight, leak-free seal. The kit comes complete with the discharge tube, vacuum plugs for the stock hoses, and instructions. The tube is powdercoated in black and with a wrinkle finish for an OE appearance.     2008-2010    135i 1M  2007-2010    335i 335xi 335i xDrive  2007-2010    335i 335is 335xi 335i xDrive  2007-2010    335i"
