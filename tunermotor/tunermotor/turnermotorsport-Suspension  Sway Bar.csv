The stock aluminum sway bar brackets in the E39 5-Series suffer from a serious design flaw that has resulted in many people experiencing snapping and misshapen brackets, a mounting tab that is simply too weak. Not only was the OE bracket not designed to handle the loads required, but the aluminum construction was also easily fatigued over time, making an already questionable bracket weaker over time. This sub-par construction eventually leads to the mounting tab breaking off, releasing all tension on the sway bar, causing sloppy handling feel and knocking noises in the rear of your BMW. Luckily for all of us, the fix is simple. By swapping the construction from aluminum to steel, while maintaining all of the original dimensions, these brackets offer 3 times the mounting strength versus the OE brackets! This ensures that no matter how many track days or spirited weekends of driving your BMW sees, you can rest easy knowing your rear sway bar is securely mounted. To top it all off, these brackets are also zinc-coated, keeping away rust and corrosion for years. Why go steel E39 brackets instead of using E38 brackets? Fitment. Although the E38 bracket is a commonly suggested upgrade, it does require a bit of modification to fit properly and usually results in a bit of bushing compression, making your sway bar difficult to install."

       ...",338359,31351134582A,$116.05,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-131-bmw-sway-bar#,"This single swaybar link is adjustable to eliminate preload on the front sway bar in E30 M3, E36 M3, E46, and Z4 models. Preload is tension on the bar when the car is at rest on the ground. Ideally, the bar should be neutral with zero tension on both ends (no twist in the bar at rest). Preload comes from inconsistent side-side ride height (such as with coil overs), a bent swaybar, a bent strut housing, or a chassis with bent or skewed frame rails. The handling is affected with a preloaded sway bar so removing that tension will give you more consistent handling and response. Preloading can also lead to premature failure of the link ball joints.   To remove preload you only need an adjustable link on one side of the car. Install your stock swaybar link on one side, lower the car to the ground, adjust the Turner link to meet the swaybar hole on the other side, and tighten everything up. Never install both sway bar links with the tires off the ground. Our link is made from a stock HD swaybar link with an easily adjusted hex rod in the middle.   One link or two? Technically, the remove preload only one link is required. However, there may be cases where having two links is better. Having an adjustable link on both sides of the car will allow you to better position the front sway bar for clearance or when a different racing style coil over is used.     1988-1991    M3  1995-1999    M3  1999-2006    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 328i 328ci 330i 330ci M3  1982-1988    524td 528e 533i 535i 535is M5  1989-1995    525i 530i 535i 540i M5  1982-1989    633csi 635csi M6  2003-2008    Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si Z4 M Roadster M Coupe"

Along with the ability to remove preload you can change the length to maximize sway bar geometry.

This is the best combination we could find to reduce body roll while making handling as neutral as possible. These are the latest generation of our popular Turner E36 swaybars, now with CNC machined ends, two adjustment positions on each bar, re-countoured bends for better clearance, and one of the largest front solid sway bars available (30mm). We couldn't find a large front sway bar that we liked so we made our own - perfect for taming that understeer! These sway bars fit all 1992-1999 BMW E36 chassis, including the E36 M3, 325i, 325is, 328i, 328is, 323is, 318i and 318is (sorry, no ti). Perfect for street use and great for competition / track applications.     These bars fit in the stock locations using the original brackets and links. Our bar has been designed to use either the non-M or M3 front sway bar links. Adjustable links are not required but recommended if the car is lowered or if you have coil overs. The rear hardware has been upgraded in our kit to a M10 sized bolt and it can be a little tricky to install on the factory end link. Contact us if you would like to have new links included with the hardware pre-installed. To avoid pre-loading the bar, it is best to leave one side un-done until the car is lowered to the ground. Never connect both links to the same bar with the car off the ground. We strongly recommend installing our Turner E36 Rear Sway Bar Reinforcement Kit at the same time as any rear bar install.     The adjustable sway bar links ensure that there is no pre-load on the bar and that the bar has the correct clearance to other suspension components. Pre-load is when the bar is slightly stressed when it's on the car. If you have to force the links to fit the bar because it has tension then you have pre-load. Adjustable links fix all of that because you can then shorten or lengthen the link to match the installation of the bar. If you have coil overs or the car is very low, you should definitely have the adjustable links because these conditions may contribute to the pre-load situation. Adjustable front or rear links can be added from the options listed below.     The bars are adjustable so any driver can find an ideal setup for the type of driving they are doing. The sway bar becomes stiffer in the holes    from the end of the bar. The holes at the very end of the bar are the softest setting. We would generally recommend starting out with the front bar set to the stiffer setting and the rear bar positioned in the soft setting.

Not only was the OE bracket not designed to handle the loads required, but the aluminum construction was also easily fatigued over time, making an already questionable bracket weaker over time. This sub-par construction eventually leads to the mounting tab breaking off, releasing all tension on the sway bar, causing sloppy handling feel and knocking noises in the rear of your BMW. Luckily for all of us, the fix is simple. By swapping the construction from aluminum to steel, while maintaining all of the original dimensions, these brackets offer 3 times the mounting strength versus the OE brackets! This ensures that no matter how many track days or spirited weekends of driving your BMW sees, you can rest easy knowing your rear sway bar is securely mounted. To top it all off, these brackets are also zinc-coated, keeping away rust and corrosion for years. Why go steel E39 brackets instead of using E38 brackets? Fitment. Although the E38 bracket is a commonly suggested upgrade, it does require a bit of modification to fit properly and usually results in a bit of bushing compression, making your sway bar difficult to install."

With these bars you can greatly reduce bodyroll and decrease the understeering effects of a staggered wheel setup. They are adjustable in the front (3-position) and the rear (2-position) to fine tune the handling for both the street and the track. The Turner bars are sized at 30mm in the front and 25mm in the rear (+4 and +3.5mm from stock, respectively). We supply them with a urethane bushing with a reinforced inner core that requires no lubrication or maintenance so you won?t have to put up with annoying squeaks and annual greasing work. These bars are crafted from a special spring steel that is both stronger and more resilient than competitive sway bars. They have been shot peened and heat treated, and feature precision forged ends. We feel that these are the best bars on the market for the E46 M3 - we have used these on our race-winning M3s in the Koni Challenge and SCCA T2 classes.     These bars fit in the stock locations using the original brackets and links. Our bar has been designed to use the stock M3 front sway bar links. Adjustable links are not required but recommended if the car is lowered or if you have coil overs. The rear hardware has been upgraded in our kit to a M10 sized bolt and it can be a little tricky to install on the factory end link. To avoid pre-loading the bar, it is best to leave one side un-done until the car is lowered to the ground. Never connect both links to the same bar with the car off the ground.     The adjustable sway bar links ensure that there is no pre-load on the bar and that the bar has the correct clearance to other suspension components. Pre-load is when the bar is slightly stressed when it's on the car. If you have to force the links to fit the bar because it has tension then you have pre-load. Adjustable links fix all of that because you can then shorten or lengthen the link to match the installation of the bar. If you have coil overs or the car is very low, you should definitely have the adjustable links because these conditions may contribute to the pre-load situation. Adjustable front or rear links can be added from the options listed below.     The bars are adjustable so any driver can find an ideal setup for the type of driving they are doing. The sway bar becomes stiffer in the holes    from the end of the bar. The holes at the very end of the bar are the softest setting. We would generally recommend starting out with the front bar set to the stiffer setting and the rear bar positioned in the soft setting. Adjust to your liking from there.        2001-2006    M3"

From years of racing the E36 in World Challenge we have discovered the E36 favors a larger front bar without over doing the size of the rear. We normally pair this front bar with our 24mm rear bar. This is the best combination we could find to reduce body roll while making handling as neutral as possible. The swaybar sits in a polyurethane bushing which has a squeak resistant lining. Perfect for street use and great for competition / track applications.

Tasked with keeping suspension geometry in check while absorbing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) factory rubber bushings were engineered to provide a balance of comfort and control. As a factory bushingÂ ages, it becomes brittle and begins to harden. When this happens the bushing will actuallyÂ shrink and allowÂ excess play in the suspensionÂ joint. This is typically felt by a sudden jerk forward after the car comes to a stop and is a leading cause ofÂ ""sloppy"" or ""loose"" suspension feel. By replacing the bushing with a full polyurethane unit or using a bushing insert, this play is eliminated since the suspension joint is being supported by a much stiffer material that will not harden or shrink over time. Additionally, the inherent stiffness of the urethane material translates body forces much more directly. This means steering inputs from the driver are effectively transferred to the wheels and vital road information is transmitted properly from the wheels to the driver."

We use the 30mm M3 front bar combined with the 21mm E46 non-M rear bar. From our time racing the E46 in World Challenge, Grand-Am, and SCCA club racing we found that the E46 likes a stiffer sway bar and less spring rate. Taking the M3 front bar, which is solid, is exactly what we wanted. They are adjustable in the front (3-position) and the rear (2-position) to fine tune the handling. Bushings are included and new adjustable links are optional. These bars are crafted from a special spring steel that is both stronger and more resilient than competitive sway bars. They have been shot peened and heat treated, and feature precision forged ends.   Setup: The bars are adjustable so any driver can find an ideal setup for the type of driving they are doing. The sway bar becomes stiffer in the holes    from the end of the bar. The holes at the very end of the bar are the softest setting. We would generally recommend starting out with the front bar set to the stiffer setting and the rear bar positioned in the soft setting. Adjust to your liking from there. When using these in a non-SE46 setup (or other struts beside MCS) the strut housing may have to be rotated in the spindle so that the sway bar link lines up better with the sway bar tab on the strut.   Adjustable sway bar links are strongly advised to ensure that there is no pre-load on the bars. And to position the bar so that it has the correct clearance to other suspension components. Pre-load is when the bar is slightly stressed when it's on the car, from differing ride heights or from the chassis being slightly twisted. With the SE46 coil overs the adjustable links are a smart idea. If you have to force the links to fit the bar because it has tension then you have pre-load. Adjustable front or rear links can be added from the options listed below.     1999-2006    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 328i 328ci 330i 330ci  2001-2006    330i 330ci"

Don't be let down by the ""small"" size compared to the factory sway bar sizes - there are some big differences! We've had our in-house suspension engineers run the math and the H&R swaybar is over 52% stiffer than the factory E90/E92 M3 bar and even over 42% stiffer than the E93 M3 sway bar upgrade. There are several reasons for this - the stock sway bars are hollow (for lighter weight) and will twist more than the solid H&R bar. Also, the E93 M3 bar is often called a 28mm bar but it actually tapers down in the center to 24mm which greatly reduces its effectiveness. So if you're looking for a serious sway bar upgrade, the H&R is clearly the way to go. Note: to maintain the handling balance of the car, we recommend only using the front bar with the matching H&R rear bar or heavily revised racing suspension.For a more in-depth analysis of the E9X front sway bar differences, This bar re-uses the factory M3 sway bar bushings and brackets.2011+  1M Coupe2008+  M32008+  M3"

This is the real factory Euro M5 front swaybar! It's a hefty 25mm in diameter and with less bends than the other 25mm Sport sway bars. The fewer bends means the bar is stiffer so even people with the stock 25mm Sport swaybar will feel a (small) difference. The bar includes new rubber bushings and mounts to the car with the original bushing brackets and sway bar links.   If you're upgrading from a standard swaybar you should strongly consider also purchasing the Nurburgring 20mm rear sway bar at the same time. Sway bars work best when balanced with the rest of the chassis. Using a front bar that is too large in relation to the rear bar (and other suspension upgrades) can result in undesirable handling.   This front swaybar fits all E34 except the 1991-1995 525i (M50 engine). Fitting to the M50 cars can be done but requires modification to the front subframe and other pieces.     1989-1990    525i  1989-1995    530i 535i 540i

It's a 12mm diameter which is perfect for a mild suspension upgrade, especially when using factory or mild aftermarket springs. The base 128i did not come with any rear sway bar which makes this a big upgrade (requires mounting kit, see below). The 135i had a stock 11mm rear sway bar so the effect will be less dramatic.   On the 128i models that did not have a sport package, BMW did not install a rear sway bar. Adding one will make the car feel 'snappier' with more rear end drifting. It will be easier to get into an oversteer situation which makes this upgrade suitable for autocross or other tight cornering environments. If you are upgrading from no rear bar you will need the brackets, rear links, and hardware. We have packaged these pieces together in a kit for you - add it to your order from the options below.

If you have an E34 sport suspension, E34 M5, 540i M Sport, or aftermarket cars the difference will be smaller. But since BMW installed this as part of a factory handling package it will be an improvement for track, autocross, or backroad handling."
