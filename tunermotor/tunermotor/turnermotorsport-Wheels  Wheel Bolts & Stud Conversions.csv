One was that not all lug-nuts are made the same. While the standard nuts that we sell are great for daily drivers, HPDE events, and club racing, a beefier and more durable nut was needed for the 3-hour, 6-hour, and 24-hour professional endurance races. During the 24 Hours of Daytona, our crew guys made over 80 tire changes in NASCAR-style pitstops. That kind of abuse from air guns and fast work required the ""next level"" of lug-nut. These nuts are a high-grade steel with a zinc coating and they incorporate several innovative features.   The wheel-side of the nut has recessed threads so that the nut has to be square to engage the threads. Without the recess, it’s far too easy to start the threads with the nut being crooked.   The 19mm head of the nut is slightly rounded to help the socket find its position.   The zinc plating that we use is reasonably durable without being excessive. With too much coating, the chipped and worn coating fragments can end up in the threads, leading to all sorts of trouble. Anyone who has used nuts repeatedly knows that the coating is not going to last forever. The constant abuse from air guns will chip it all away. So why add weight and the potential for disaster with excess coating? We did away with most of the danger from that with a lighter coating that still resists the tough environment of the track.",,

We don't take a manufacturer's generic wheel stud from their catalog and call it our own. Turner Wheel Studs are designed to our own specifications and manufactured for us exclusively. Beware of cheaper studs on the market! We have seen other studs similar to our own designs that are not a true BMW fitment. There are differences that we have ironed out over our years of selling wheel studs for the BMW market. Our stud prices may be slightly higher than the rock bottom prices on the web but we promise that it's a higher quality.    These wheel studs are the same as our hugely popular Bullet Nose studs but with threads along the full length of the stud. This gives you more threaded area for tightening wheel nuts or allows the use of a closed-end wheel nut. These also have a more OEM appearance. Although these are a lower cost version of our Bullet Nose studs, they are every bit as strong, durable, and safe. The Bullet Nose is an upgrade because it's easier to install and almost impossible to cross-thread a nut.",,

We recommend the 90mm length for cars that have a spacer larger than 15mm. These studs come with a black magnesium phosphate coating for excellent corrosion resistance. These studs are perfect for dual-purpose street/track cars. The studs are stronger and safer than wheel bolts and have a barrier against corrosion which makes them suitable for street use. For a dedicated race or track car, where wheel changes or pit stops are more frequent, check out our racing dry lube studs. Our studs are also designed and manufactured with the properly sized shank to work with a wider range of BMW wheel, nut, and brake rotor combinations. We intentionally avoid the extra large shoulders you see on other studs because they can interfere with some brake rotor hats. The extra-large shoulder can be too large to allow the rotor to pass through and drilling out the holes is required (not cool!)

This wheel nut has a reduced outer flange for a more compact and minimal fitment. On many wheels, the hole for the lugbolt or lugnut is a very narrow diameter. Not even the stock lugbolt will fit through and these wheels often come with their own lugbolts. Then when adding studs to the car the options for a small diameter lug nut are very limited. We ran into this problem over and over and finally found a solution! These compact lugs have all of the material of a 19mm nut but without the flange of a standard wheel nut. For this reason we do not recommend using these on a wheel that normally takes a standard bolt seat (the seat is very important to the strength and integrity of the design). But for wheels that are designed to use a small seat, these are the solution! Bright and durable zinc finish makes them easy to spot during fast pitstop tire changes.   Priced per nut.  Thin-wall 19mm socket may be required depending on your wheel design.",,

One was that not all lug-nuts are made the same. While the standard nuts that we sell are great for daily drivers, HPDE events, and club racing, a beefier and more durable nut was needed for the 3-hour, 6-hour, and 24-hour professional endurance races. During the 24 Hours of Daytona, our crew guys made over 80 tire changes in NASCAR-style pitstops. That kind of abuse from air guns and fast work required the ""next level"" of lug-nut. These nuts are a high-grade steel with a zinc coating and they incorporate several innovative features.   The wheel-side of the nut has recessed threads so that the nut has to be square to engage the threads. Without the recess, it�s far too easy to start the threads with the nut being crooked.   The 19mm head of the nut is slightly rounded to help the socket find its position.   The zinc plating that we use is reasonably durable without being excessive. With too much coating, the chipped and worn coating fragments can end up in the threads, leading to all sorts of trouble. Anyone who has used nuts repeatedly knows that the coating is not going to last forever. The constant abuse from air guns will chip it all away. So why add weight and the potential for disaster with excess coating? We did away with most of the danger from that with a lighter coating that still resists the tough environment of the track.",,
