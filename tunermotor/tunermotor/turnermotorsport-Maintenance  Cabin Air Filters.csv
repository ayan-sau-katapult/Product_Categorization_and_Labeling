If you have noticed that your heat or A/C is not blowing as strong as normal, this could be due to a clogged filter. Swap out your dirty, old filter to ensure your air is clean and easy-flowing! Filters that incorporate activated charcoal offer further protection than standard dust and pollen filters. The layers of activated charcoal within the filter are able to absorb unpleasant odors and reduce allergens levels significantly over stock-style standard filters. Cabin filters should be changed out every 30,000 miles to maintain optimal comfort. If you have noticed reduced airflow through your HVAC system before this point, the filter is most likely clogged and should be replaced early to prevent air pollutants from circulating through the vehicle's cabin."

Cain filters are an important part of the climate control system that filters out contaminants in the air that you breathe. If you have noticed that your heat or A/C is not blowing as strong as normal, this could be due to a clogged filter. Swap out your dirty, old filter to ensure your air is clean and easy-flowing! Cabin filters should be changed out every 30,000 miles to maintain optimal comfort. If you have noticed reduced airflow through your HVAC system before this point, the filter is most likely clogged and should be replaced early to prevent air pollutants from circulating through the vehicle's cabin."
