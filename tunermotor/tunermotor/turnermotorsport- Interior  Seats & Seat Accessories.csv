The Flexible Adapter mounts are a reinforced side mount + slider assembly intended for pro endurance racing. These are the first FIA-certified seat sliders. They have extra reinforcing braces on the front and rear which takes away a lot of the lateral motion from traditional un-reinforced side mount brackets. As racecars see more lateral loading from high downforce and stickier tires the seat naturally wants to flex even more. This extra strength seat slider/mount combination is just the thing to keep you planted in place. Even the slider hand bar is overbuilt and bright red for to grab your attention. These have been designed by Recaro specifically for endurance races where driver changes need to be done in seconds.   This slider + mount system only works with the Recaro Pro Racer SPA/SPG seats. Choose from the standard size or XL version.
