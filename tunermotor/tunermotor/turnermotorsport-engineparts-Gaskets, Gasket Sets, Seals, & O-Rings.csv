Oil leaks - and the damage they can cause - seem to be the worst annoyances on these cars. The biggest source of an oil leak is from the valve cover, followed by the oil filter housing, Valvetronic seal, camshaft seals, and the eccentric shaft sensor seal. Once the oil leaks, and if ignored for an extended time, the oil will contaminate vital electrical sensors. This is especially the case with ignition coils and also the eccentric shaft sensor on the Valvetronic shaft at the top of the cylinder head. During any ignition coil and spark plug replacement take a close look inside for any oil pooling at the bottom. We have been seeing valve cover oil leaks as soon as 40,000 miles.

Using a complete gasket set will save you time and money if you have the engine out of the car and are performing any major repairs with the oil pan and timing covers off the motor. This is the correct S14 bottom-end gasket set, not a re-packaged M10 kit.This set of gaskets is a both a time and money saver. It includes all of the commonly replaced gaskets, seals, and o-rings when performing this overhaul. Having these on hand instead of chasing them down at the last minute will save you time, money, and frustration. With this area of the engine apart you're going to want or need to replace these items anyway to ensure it's free of fluid and vacuum leaks. This is especially important because some states have very strict emissions regulations and vacuum and oil leaks can lead to failed inspections tests. On newer cars this can also create issues in the on-board diagnostics system. Even if you're not pulling the head this set includes so many valuable parts you'll want to keep this on hand to use for spares.With more than 100 years in the industry, Elring is one of the oldest names in the European autoparts segment.

Oil leaks - and the damage they can cause - seem to be the worst annoyances on these cars. The biggest source of an oil leak is from the valve cover, followed by the oil filter housing, Valvetronic seal, camshaft seals, and the eccentric shaft sensor seal. Once the oil leaks, and if ignored for an extended time, the oil will contaminate vital electrical sensors. This is especially the case with ignition coils and also the eccentric shaft sensor on the Valvetronic shaft at the top of the cylinder head. During any ignition coil and spark plug replacement take a close look inside for any oil pooling at the bottom. We have been seeing valve cover oil leaks as soon as 40,000 miles. We look for oil leaks on every E90 that comes into our shop.   We have put together this package of valve cover gaskets and other related gaskets and seals for you to fully overhaul the N52 valve cover and put a stop to those pesky oil leaks. This package has the replacement parts for N52 engines built from the 2007 model year and includes:     2007 and later N51/N52 engines do not need replacement valve cover bolts, unless the bolts are actually broken off or missing. Unlike the 2006 aluminum hardware, the later parts are steel and not 1-time use.   These are all OEM or OE parts. Replacement of these gaskets and seals is straight-forward but a long process. BMW dealers typically charge for over eight hours of labor. If you have replaced spark plugs before you should be capable of this repair. In addition, there are several other parts to replace while you're in the vicinity: camshaft sensor o-rings, oil filter housing profile gasket, VAN0S solenoids, and the eccentric shaft sensor. These other parts, except the eccentric shaft sensor (see below), are replaceable without removing the valve cover but are more easily accessed during the valve cover work.   Eccentric Shaft Sensor: This is the position sensor that relays the eccentric shaft's position back to the DME. It's located at the front of the engine and   . The seal around the sensor can fail and allow oil to blow out from under the cam cover. Oil can then leak into the sensor itself and cause it to fail. Without a functioning sensor your E90 can experience poor running, hesitation, poor performance, jerky shifts, and sluggish response. It's easy to check and see if oil has accumulated inside the sensor: unbolt the engine trim cover (the outer cover with the BMW roundel), unplug the sensor, and look inside. If oil is present inside or even around the sensor itself, plan on replacing this sensor during your next ignition coil, spark plug, and/or valve cover gasket work.     2008-2012    128i  2007-2011    328i 328xi 328i xDrive - Sedan  2007-2012    328i 328xi 328i xDrive - Wagon  2007-2013    328i 328xi 328i xDrive - Coupe  2007-2013    328i - Convertible  2007-2010    528i 528xi 528i xDrive  2011    528i  2007-2010    X3 3.0i X3 3.0si  2007-2013    X5 3.0si  10/2006-2008    Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si  2009+    Z4 sDrive30i"

With so many individual requirements for each motor, Cometic offers a number of options to suit your specific motor and needs. *MLS* The Cometic MLS gasket is comprised of three layers of Stainless Steel. Cometic uses Stainless steel for increased strength, it’s ability to rebound and corrosion resistance. The outer layers of the gasket are embossed and coated on both sides with a flouroelastomer rubber based material (Viton) designed to meet the demands of a variety of harsh sealing environments, load conditions, and surface finishes. The Viton coating is heat resistant to 2500C or 4820F. The center or shim layer of the gasket is comprised of an uncoated Stainless Steel layer, which can be varied to accommodate multiple thickness requirements. The MLS gasket is ideal for both aluminum heads to cast iron blocks and aluminum heads to aluminum blocks. The composition of MLS will also withstand the shearing forces created by aluminum heads on cast iron blocks. No re-torque is necessary. By design, the MLS gasket promotes an even torque load across the sealing surface allowing for measurably reduced bore distortion. *CFM-20* A perforated steel core with an elastomer surface is ideal for head gaskets allowing heat to be drawn evenly across the gasket surface while providing maximum sealing characteristics when exposed to coolants and oils."

The housing is separate from the engine block and in between there is this small profile gasket. The gasket shrinks over time which allows oil to seep out. In our own service shop, it's one of the most common service jobs we perform.   One of the other common leak points is the VANOS oil line and its seals. Since the line comes out with the oil filter housing anyway you might as well replace the line itself or at least the seals.   On S54 engines (E46 M3, MZ3, Z4 M) there is a flanged head bolt going into the cylinder head, behind the thermostat cover. This holds the left side timing chain guide rail in place and if it's loose or falls out you could have a very serious engine failure to deal with.

The housing is separate from the engine block and in between there is this small profile gasket. The gasket shrinks over time which allows oil to seep out. In our own service shop, it's one of the most common service jobs we perform. One of the other common leak points is the VAN0S oil line and its seals. Since the line comes out with the oil filter housing anyway you might as well replace the line itself or at least the seals. On S54 engines (E46 M3, MZ3, Z4 M) there is a flanged head bolt going into the cylinder head, behind the thermostat cover. This holds the left side timing chain guide rail in place and if it's loose or falls out you could have a very serious engine failure to deal with. Make sure to check this bolt while you're replacing the oil filter housing seal. You only need to make sure it's tight. But if it's come loose you may want to replace the seal ring and use a small touch of oil-resistant thread sealer."

The filter housing meets the block and a profile gasket is supposed to keep the dirty oil from entering the engine and to retain the oil as it makes it way out and back into the block. Unfortunately, the dirty oil and contaminants can build up along the edge of the gasket and push it out of place. Heat around the various surfaces can also warp or shrink the gasket. In any event this spot is well-known for oil seepage and leaks. Replacement can be done on its own but is best tackled along with a new valve cover gasket (another common leak source).

The filter housing meets the block and a profile gasket is supposed to keep the dirty oil from entering the engine and to retain the oil as it makes it way out and back into the block. Unfortunately, the dirty oil and contaminants can build up along the edge of the gasket and push it out of place. Heat around the various surfaces can also warp or shrink the gasket. In any event this spot is well-known for oil seepage and leaks. Replacement can be done on its own but is best tackled along with a new valve cover gasket (another common leak source). This replacement gasket and fits all N51, N52, N54, and N55 engines.

This is especially important because some states have very strict emissions regulations and vacuum and oil leaks can lead to failed inspections tests.
