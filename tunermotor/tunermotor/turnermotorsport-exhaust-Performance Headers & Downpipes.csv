Adding headers and removing catalytic converters from the exhaust is one of the top things to do to make more power. The factory put the cats in the stock exhaust manifold which restricts exhaust flow. But any race or track car will want to run without cats to gain the most power and torque. We used these on our in-house 330i ZHP project car. These Supersprint stainless headers are a true tubular design that bolts up for an immediate power gain. With no cats and a race exhaust, you can expect to gain 20-25hp over the stock exhaust setup. Power gains with a cat section depend on the type of cat. Supersprint exhaust is widely recognized as the leader in complete exhaust system upgrades - extremely high quality, well designed for optimal flow, and amazing sound. Even at a premium price, Supersprint is an unbeatable exhaust system because every aspect is done to such a high level. A Supersprint exhaust rewards you with a terrific sound, long-lasting construction, and excellent fitment. The Supersprint sound is very 'European' which fits the sporting sophistication of BMWs perfectly. Most systems are also modular - sections can be added or removed to custom tailor the exhaust sound to your preference. Aside from 'Race' systems, their mufflers meet European noise laws so you get a refined and tuned sound without being excessively loud. Supersprint exhausts generally run at a premium over other systems but no other system on the market can match their quality, performance, or reputation!"

Supersprint makes these tubular stainless headers for the Euro-spec E36 M3 but they make a great upgrade when fitted to highly tuned US models. The Euro exhaust uses larger diameter tubing because the Euro engines move so much air at high RPM. A US car with all of the typical bolt-on upgrades can also benefit from these larger pipes as it allows the engine to move the exhaust gasses easier. If you have the M50 manifold, cams, head work, or even forced induction, don't let your exhaust be your weakest link! Less work means more torque and horsepower are freed up to actually propel the car.

Note for all E36 models: the Euro exhaust has a very different layout than the US models. These headers are for the Euro M3 and will only fit US cars when used with the rest of the Euro exhaust system (center section with muffler) or a custom exhaust from these headers back. Note for 96-99 models: these headers include O2 sensor bungs but no ports for the US secondary air pump. Therefore, these Euro headers are not intended for street-based cars and should only be used for racing or track use with special software, OBD-I conversion, or stand-alone engine management.

These are then tested on our in-house MAHA Dynamometer enabling us to recognise the optimum setup. We also ensure the 02 sensor bungs remain in their original position for ideal fitting. Supersprint headers are manufactured using industry leading techniques from the best German 304 and 310S stainless steel with piping thickness variable from 1 to 1.5mm, along with CNC machined, hi-precision laser cut flanges built from 409 and 304 steel for perfect fitment and longevity. The joints are TIG welded in order to guarantee strength and durability. For temperature critical, delicate applications we also use Inconel for some of our products.  These materials and processes ensure Supersprint headers are extremely high quality, durable products that offer true, tangible performance gains."

They were the first set of headers we used back in 2001. These eliminate the original US catalytic converters in the stock UE manifold (the Euro cats are under the car in the exhaust center section). With no restriction the Euro headers will gain over 15hp from a stock US M3 (slightly less gain if using sport cats in section 1).   There are a lot of different headers for the E46 M3 but many of them are cheap copies of the true Euro headers. These are the genuine article without the quality issues and fitment nightmares of ultra-cheap imitations. Since these are Genuine BMW parts they are a direct fit to your engine with the proper flanges and routing with no interference with the air pump or other accessories. These can re-use the original exhaust studs on the engine and factory gaskets. New gaskets and hardware are highly recommended (offered separately below). Since these are straight off the Euro M3 they do not have the same port locations for the post-cat O2 sensors or EGT sensor. These can be added by your installer or run special software to run without them.   Since these headers replace the factory US catalytic converters they are sold for race and off-road use only. If your series requires a catalytic converter there are multiple options for sport cats in section 1. Special software will be required to prevent check engine lights and fault codes.       2001-2006    M3  2001-2002    Z3 M Roadster M Coupe
