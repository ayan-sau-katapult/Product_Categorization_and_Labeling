The advantages of a fully-solid aluminum set is that they last forever, quickens response in the suspension, and frees up horsepower to the wheels. These fully solid aluminum diff mounts are CNC machined and lightened for a direct replacement of the original rubber pieces.   By substituting aluminum for rubber we can take out all of the deflection and 'wind up' inherent to the original rubber pieces. The high deflection rate of the stock rubber means the suspension reacts slower as the bushing is compressed. The power used to compress that bushing is instead passed straight to the axles and wheels. And since there is no time lost to deflection, response is greatly improved. These diff mounts are only recommended for racecars since the aluminum transfers more noise and vibration.   This is a 3-piece set with a single front bushing and two rear bushings to press into the cover. They mount with the stock BMW hardware.     2001-2006    M3"

The differential is part of the subframe, as it is a stress member system. When the subframe moves, so do all of the rear suspension mounting points. Replacing the stock rubber subframe bushings with solid aluminum will limit drivetrain and suspension movement and keep your car’s suspension geometry the way it’s supposed to be. The Delrin diff mount bushing is a near-solid mount that will last longer than the original rubber and does not 'wind up' under load/unload. This transfers more power through the axles to the wheels. The Turner Motorsport E36 318ti and Z3 solid subframe and differential mount bushing kit is a direct replacement for the stock BMW subframe mounts and differential bushing. We have incorporated ideas from our other race style solid bushings not only make these very light weight but also to be fully serviceable and removable in the case of subframe or diff cover replacement. This kit is a legal upgrade in many racing classes.   Note: solid subframe mounts are only sold with the solid diff mount. Using a rubber diff mount with the solid subframe mount will result in excessive deflection and twist in the diff mount.

Not only can you get more performance but you can also address the weak points in the M Variable limited slip diff. It's easy to forget about the rear axle when you're considering performance upgrades but changing the gearing is in the top 3 things to do to make the car faster. A custom diff is also a rebuilt unit with new seals, bearings, and limited slip unit.     The E46 M3 diff comes with a relatively short 3.62 gear ratio. They could use a shorter gear because the engine redline is so high - the car has a long power band and the gear spacing allows you to stay well within that range. There's always more acceleration to be had with a shorter gear set. BMW Motorsport supplies 3.91 or 4.10 options and there are other gear ratios to select in our custom builds. Your speed vs RPM obviously changes with a different gear set. Use the chart below for examples of the differences.        The M3's M Variable locking differential is genius when it's working properly. Unfortunately, as many M3 owners have come to find, the system only has a service life of 80,000 miles (sometimes less) and then the viscous unit inside starts to fail (is your's clunking?).

The rear bushing is a Meyle HD upgrade over stock - about 15% stiffer than the originals. This means the bushing will not flex and twist as much. This puts more power to the wheels since power is no longer used up for 'torquing' the bushing. These are not race bushings; the rubber material is perfectly suitable for street use.

Not only can you get more performance but you can also address the weak points in the M Variable limited slip diff. It's easy to forget about the rear axle when you're considering performance upgrades but changing the gearing is in the top 3 things to do to make the car faster. A custom diff is also a rebuilt unit with new seals, bearings, and limited slip unit.     The MZ4 diff comes with a relatively short 3.62 gear ratio. They could use a shorter gear because the engine redline is so high - the car has a long power band and the gear spacing allows you to stay well within that range. But there's always more acceleration to be had with a shorter gear set. BMW Motorsport supplies 3.91 or 4.10 options and there are other gear ratios to select in our custom builds. Your speed vs RPM obviously changes with a different gear set. Use the chart below for examples of the differences.        The M Variable locking differential is genius when it's working properly. Unfortunately, as many M3/M5/M6/Z4M owners have come to find, the system only has a service life of 80,000 miles (sometimes less) and then the viscous unit inside starts to fail (is your's clunking?). We can rebuild the internals and bring it back to a perfectly-functioning viscous M Variable unit.

A custom diff is also a rebuilt unit with new seals, bearings, and limited slip unit. Gearing The E9X M3 gearing depends on which transmission/clutch spec your car has - 6MT or the DCT. The manual transmission cars have a relatively short 3.85 gear ratio on manual transmission cars. They could use a shorter gear because the engine redline is so high - the car has a long power band and the gear spacing allows you to stay well within that range. But there's always more acceleration to be had with a shorter gear set and we have quite a few to choose from for either transmission. Your speed vs RPM obviously changes with a different gear set. Limited Slip Options The M3's M Variable locking differential is genius when it's working properly. Unfortunately, as many M3 owners have come to find, the system only has a service life of 80,000 miles (sometimes less) and then the viscous unit inside starts to fail (is your's clunking?). We can rebuild the internals and bring it back to a perfectly-functioning viscous M Variable unit.

A limited slip operates independently from either of those systems. With the LSD installed the DTC system does not engage as often. The LSD transfers torque mechanically to the opposite wheel. It will then allow some wheelspin before the traction control kicks in. If you turn off traction control you still have the torque transfer of the LSD working and then wheel spin. So you can get traction in the corner and some wheelspin out of it to facilitate rotation without engine power being cut so soon.

The M3 came with the shorter 4.10 gearing. For most E30 owners the standard gearing is well-suited for the street. If the shorter 3.73/4.10 gearing is too high for daily driving you can swap to a taller gear for lower revs (better fuel economy, less noise). On the flip side, changing to a shorter gear can work in your favor for acceleration runs or if you find yourself at the wrong RPM for certain tracks. And if you have installed an M50/S50/S52 engine the gearing should be changed as well to make better use of the new torque curve.

For the Spec E46 racing class the rules call for ""3.46 gear ratio, factory housing, flanges, and mounting points. The internal parts of the differential are otherwise unrestricted, including the use of limited slip units."" (as of September 2015). If you're not running one of these SE46 diffs you can expect to be passed by someone who is. The non-M E46 did not come with a limited slip so the benefits of using one are obvious - put down as much power as early as possible in the corner and gain more top speed on the straights. Don't sit and wait for your car to hook up in the corner while someone else has already gone by!   Our ideal SpecE46 diff is built with these options: 3-disc limited slip with 30/90 ramp angles, polished gears and polished carrier bearings, and the race carrier (see below). This setup has been tested and developed extensively on E46 330 and E46 M3 racecars. The 30deg angle on acceleration will engage the clutch discs sooner than a factory or ""standard"" LSD and give you outstanding traction accelerating out of corners. The 90deg decel will not engage the clutches so the inside drive wheel will not be pushing the car straight while you are executing braking and turn-in. This diff also works great for other E46 track cars (not just SE46). We can also build the diff in a different way if you prefer more or less clutch discs or a different style of limited slip.   A full race limited slip carrier option uses 6 clutch discs and coil springs for a completely tunable race diff. The coil springs inside the carrier control preload of the discs ensuring the limited slip is working consistently even as the discs wear. The spring tension and ramp angles can be customized for your preferences although there is a ""hot setup"" for SE46 cars already. The race carrier is also much lighter than the standard LSD units.

The shorter gearing will help accelerate the car quicker by placing the engine in a stronger part of the power band for any given speed. Being in that 'meatier' part of the power band means more torque is available at the wheels. And there is almost no downside!   The stock 545i or 550i with a manual transmission has a 2.81 final drive ratio. It's a relatively tall (numerically low) drive ratio because of the V8's torque output. But using a shorter gear (numerically higher) will take advantage of that torque output even more and give dramatically better acceleration. We rebuild the stock BMW diff with the new gear ratio, new bearings, and new seals. So not only do you get a performance improvement but also a rebuild of a potentially troublesome component. We can also add a limited-slip unit to get better traction.   By changing the gearing, you are changing the speed in relation to engine RPM. The 545i begins to make most of its torque by 2,500 RPM. With the original gear ratio, 25 MPH is 2nd gear at 2,250 RPM. With shorter 3.46 gearing at 25 MPH in 2nd you're now at 2,750 RPM - much deeper into the power band! At 70 MPH in 6th you are right at the start of the torque curve, which means you get much more thrust and maybe no need to downshift! Here are more examples of the gearing and speed differences -       The 545i/550i did not come from BMW with a limited-slip differential (posi-traction). Instead, they relied on the throttle electronics and/or brake application to limit wheelspin. The problem with this system is that as soon as it detects wheelspin the electronics cut engine power first. On later models with DSC the brakes will also be applied to the spinning wheel. And without limited-slip (an 'open' diff) it means that power is really only being directed to one wheel (not both rear wheels) - the infamous 'One Tire Fire'. Lifting the inside wheel in a corner can result in useless wheel spin, then engine power cutoff, which is futile when trying accelerate out of a corner. Instead, a limited slip differential (LSD) will transfer power from the inside to the outside wheel that has a lot more traction. We can also vary how much torque is transferred (the 'lock-up') so that you can still transfer torque and get some wheelspin at the same time (great for drifting/autocross!).

While OE rubber bushings are fine when they are new from the factory, aged and worn out rubber bushings create a multitude of issues that can range from annoying to dangerous. As a factory bushing ages, it begins to harden and become brittle. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point. At this point, the differential is free to shift under load causing a noticeable clunking noise under acceleration and deceleration and massively increasing the stress on the driveshaft and axles. Manual transmissions suffer the worst from this as it can make shifting difficult since the differential will shift when the clutch is engaged and disengaged."

The shorter gearing will help accelerate the car quicker by placing the engine in a stronger part of the power band for any given speed. Being in that 'meatier' part of the power band means more torque is available at the wheels. And there is almost no downside!   The stock 540i has either a 2.81 or 3.15 final drive ratio. Both are relatively tall (numerically low) because of the 540's torque output and 6-speed transmission. But using a shorter gear (numerically higher) will take advantage of that torque output even more and give dramatically better acceleration. We rebuild the stock BMW diff with the new gear ratio, new bearings, and new seals. So not only do you get a performance improvement but also a rebuild of a potentially troublesome component. We can also add a limited-slip unit to get better traction.   By changing the gearing, you are changing the speed in relation to engine RPM. The 540i begins to make most of its torque at 2,700 RPM. With the original gear ratio, 25 MPH is 2nd gear at 2,500 RPM. With shorter 3.46 gearing at 25 MPH in 2nd you're now at 3,000 RPM - much deeper into the power band! At 70 MPH in 6th you are right at the start of the torque curve, which means you get much more thrust and maybe no need to downshift! Here are more examples of the gearing and speed differences -       The 540i did not come from BMW with a limited-slip differential (posi-traction). Instead, they relied on the throttle electronics and/or brake application to limit wheelspin. The problem with this system is that as soon as it detects wheelspin the electronics cut engine power first. On later models with DSC the brakes will also be applied to the spinning wheel. And without limited-slip (an 'open' diff) it means that power is really only being directed to one wheel (not both rear wheels) - the infamous 'One Tire Fire'. Lifting the inside wheel in a corner can result in useless wheel spin, then engine power cutoff, which is futile when trying accelerate out of a corner. Instead, a limited slip differential (LSD) will transfer power from the inside to the outside wheel that has a lot more traction. We can also vary how much torque is transferred (the 'lock-up') so that you can still transfer torque and get some wheelspin at the same time (great for drifting/autocross!).     If we are building a diff from our own stock a refundable core charge will apply until we get your original diff back. You have a maximum of 30 days from the time you receive the diff to send it back us for a refund.             1997-2003    540i"

There are a lot of options to make improvements to the diff including gear sizing changes, added limited slip units, and limited slip lock-up options. It's easy to overlook the differential when planning your car's upgrades but it's one of the best areas to get return from your modification spending. Using a shorter (numerically higher) gear ratio will give you better acceleration and the limited slip effect will help get that power to the pavement. Changing the limited slip lock-up will change how the car behaves in corners - low lock-up will introduce more wheel spin; a higher lock-up will give more grip to the rear wheels but may induce an understeer condition (too much power pushing the car straight); a variable lock-up will give you the optimum balance. Our experience in diff building, car prep, and racing will ensure we get you the correct custom build for your specific driving conditions.     Using a shorter gear ratio (numerically higher) will give you better acceleration but will reduce your top speed. The higher ratio puts you at a higher RPM point for any given speed. This puts you further up in the power band, giving you more torque to the ground. Refer to the chart below for examples."

Continuous friction in your engine creates tiny metal particles that contaminate the oil. These particles are measured in microns (one millionth of a meter: 25 microns = .001""). Oil filters catch the particles larger than about 35 microns, but they do not remove the smaller particles. Even after an oil change, there are still contaminants left in the engine. Over time, these metal particles are circulated millions of times, polishing (wearing) down the metal components inside your engine, degrading its performance and shortening the engine's life until it wears out. Magnetic drain plugs remove the smaller metal particles the oil filter can't, extending the useful life of your engine. It is also less likely that you will experience oil oxidation, as the metal particles that contribute to the process of oxidation adhere to the magnet.

On a tuned 335i you may have noticed more driveline shudder or problems hooking up during hard launches. What happens is the stock rubber bushings are under constant flex as engine torque is transmitted through the differential. Under normal driving with a stock car the bushings are rarely stressed. But factor in significant additional torque from a tuned N54/N55 and the stock rubber will quickly show its weaknesses. You may have even broken a diff bolt or two as the heavy differential shifts around. Even non-turbo E82 and E9X models may benefit from fresh bushings.This is a set of stock rubber bushings, made by OEM supplier Lemforder. They are the same as the Genuine BMW E9X diff mount bushings, but without the more expensive branding. If you're turned off by potential side effects of urethane or Delrin then the OEM diff mounts are your best option. The OEM mounts fit and perform just like the originals so there is no second guessing their quality. If you're looking for an upgrade we offer  that work well, even in street applications.E9X Diff Mount Set includes:"

The standard gearing on the manual transmission cars is 3.15 or 3.23, making this E90 diff significantly shorter. This diff is from a 330i automatic where the gear ratio has to be shorter to make up for the transmission gearing differences and extra weight. This will dramatically improve acceleration on any 325i, 328i or 330i INSTANTLY! If you are looking for better off-the-line or rolling acceleration, and are willing to sacrifice a little top-speed (some of us don't get up to 150mph), this is one of the best ways to achieve it with almost no downside. There are few things that can improve your 0-to-60 and 0-to-100 times as much as shorter gearing, and this differential is clearly a best ""bang-for-buck"" solution for dramatically better acceleration. Since this is an Original BMW part it carries the same BMW two year warranty as any other new part. So there's no need to take a chance on a used part from a private seller.

Though open differentials are fine for daily driving scenarios, enthusiasts know how important it is to have a limited slip differential when making greater than stock power. When you punch the gas and one of your wheels begins to spin with an open differential, your car is forced to rely on the traction control system to attempt to remedy the issue. By swapping out your stock open differential with a Genuine BMW limited-slip differential, you ensure that power is effectively delivered to both wheels regardless of traction conditions, keeping wheel spin to a minimum and helping to keep your BMW moving forward."

There are a lot of options to make improvements to the diff including gear sizing changes, added limited slip units, and limited slip lock-up options. It's easy to overlook the differential when planning your car's upgrades but it's one of the best areas to get return from your modification spending. Using a shorter (numerically higher) gear ratio will give you better acceleration and the limited slip effect will help get that power to the pavement. Changing the limited slip lock-up will change how the car behaves in corners - low lock-up will introduce more wheel spin; a higher lock-up will give more grip to the rear wheels but may induce an understeer condition (too much power pushing the car straight); a variable lock-up will give you the optimum balance. Our experience in diff building, car prep, and racing will ensure we get you the correct custom build for your specific driving conditions. The 128i comes from the factory with a 3.23 ratio. Using a shorter gear ratio (numerically higher) will give you better acceleration but will reduce your top speed. The higher ratio puts you at a higher RPM point for any given speed. This puts you further up in the power band, giving you more torque to the ground. Click the banner below to see examples."

This is a complete, fully-built differential that is a direct replacement swap for the stock 330i/ci 2.93 diff. On other models (323/325/328, Z4) you will need the 330's output shaft flanges (easy to install). You can find used output flanges online or we can sell you new flanges. The 3.07 gearing is 5% shorter than the stock 2.93 and will give a modest improvment in acceleration. Having the shorter ratio will put you in a better part of the RPM band for any given speed. This makes the car instantly quicker with more power and torque on tap. There's almost no downside aside from the higher revs will decrease fuel economy. Jumping from 2.93 to 3.07 is not a drastic change and was used by BMW to sell the ZHP package as a faster car than a standard 330i. For even better acceleration, try the 3.46 or 3.64 options in our custom differentials. The custom diffs will also give you a limited-slip option (this ZHP diff is still an open style).   This is an Original BMW part and carries the same BMW two year warranty as any other new BMW part. A core charge is required that can be refunded when your original diff is returned.       2001-2006    330i 330ci 330xi,    1999-2006    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci (requires 330 output flanges)  2003-2008    Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si (requires 330 output flanges)"

This race-spec LSD was developed over several seasons of competitive autocross. It uses a new high pressure ring for quicker response time and faster lockup. This makes it ideal for quick transitions and rapid on/off throttle motions typically encountered on the track. It's a one-way lockup so the car stays predictable under braking and gives the driver more feedback. For street use we prefer the normal 1.5-way setup because it's more progressive during lockup.   The biggest shortcoming of any MINI is not the lack of power - it's being able to put all of its useable power to the ground! The Cooper S is basically a one-wheel drive car and sending 200+ hp through that one tire does not live up to its full potential. A limited-slip differential is essential to any highly-tuned FWD car. The OS Giken Super-Lock is one of the most advanced clutch-type differentials on the market, and a favorite of autocrossers and road racers. The OS LSD for the MINI features ten clutch discs for a smooth and progressive lockup. By putting all of your available power to the ground you're at an instant advantage over the stock open-type differential. You'll be able to power through corners and on rough surfaces instead of uselessly spinning a wheel. Understeer is reduced by giving more bite to the tire that has the most traction. With an LSD in your MINI Cooper S you'll wonder why it wasn't first on your list to begin with (or why MINI/BMW left it out in the first place...).   The MNI OS Giken LSD uses a special 80W250 fluid that must be purchased separately.     2002-2006    MINI Cooper S (6MT manual transmission only)  2007-2013    MINI Cooper S (6MT manual transmission only)"
