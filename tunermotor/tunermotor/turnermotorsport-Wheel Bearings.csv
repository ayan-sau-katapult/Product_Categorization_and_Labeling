If the wheel turns with a gritty feel or there is a loud metal to metal noise while driving, it's likely that the bearing has failed. A simple way to check your bearing is to lift the wheel off the ground and try to move the tire back and forth, by pushing the top and bottom of the tire in. If there is play, this commonly means the wheel bearing has failed. Wheel bearings on modern vehicles are commonly pressed in. If this is the case with your vehicle, specialized tools such as a shop press may be needed for installation. Check what is required to service your wheel bearing prior to ordering to make sure you have everything you need delivered to your door.
