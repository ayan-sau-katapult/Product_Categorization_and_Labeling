Our monoball rear upper shock mounts eliminate any unwanted deflection, maximizing shock efficiency and performance - this means full body shock body articulation, reducing side loading and improving shock wear. Our Turner Motorsport rear upper shock mounts also offer flexibility in shock position - our kit enables you to either raise your shock position by 7.5mm or lower it by 4.5mm. We recommend running the raised 7.5mm for increased shock travel on lowered vehicles. On the other hand, if you're looking to retain bump stops, washers, and shock boots, you can run the 4.5mm lowered shock position. NOTE: You may experience a slight increase in NVH when using our monoball rear upper shock mounts, but we think it is justified by the eliminated deflection and setup flexibility offered by this kit. Design features: Billet CNC 6061-T6 aluminum, type III anodized for exceptional durability and corrosion resistance Teflon lined spherical bearing Self-lubricating PTFE liners are chemically bonded to the inner diameter of the race to offer a very high load-carrying capacity with greatly increased dynamic wear characteristics.

You've found it. These rear shock mounts are designed for use on the track and racing. This set of mounts will help your rear shocks perform the best they can in those conditions. The advantage to using a mount with spherical bearing is that it allows the shock to freely move off axis without side loading the shock shaft like rubber or polyurethane mounts do. Side loading a shock increases stiction and wear which decreases its efficiency. Because these are mounts without an isolator (rubber or polyurethane) to dampen road noise and vibrations we do not recommend them for street cars. These were designed in-house and developed for our own track and race cars.   These TMS bearing mounts include both 10mm and 12mm stainless steel bearing sleeves to work with a wide variety of shock shaft pins.

The mount not only locates the strut to the body of the car, it also contains bearings that allow the strut to move with the steering and travel of the suspension. It's rubber isolated to minimize vibrations and annoying road impacts from reaching the driver.   The problem that we have seen is that the rubber will wear out over time, and will no longer dampen the vibrations and harshness when contacting a bump or pothole. The driver will often feel that the car does not steer as accurately and the ride is harsher. The bearings inside can also wear out, especially when dirt and sand get into the grease. Replacement will keep the steering sharp, and noise, vibration, and harshness from spreading through the chassis. It's also a good idea to replace these any time a new strut or coil over kit is going on the car.   Price is per mount.

While the system is technically advanced with very good rates from the factory, the main weakness is that the stock twin tube shocks are susceptible to cavitation and fade in performance when pushed hard. The high pressure monotube design of the Bilstein shock effectively eliminates cavitation and ensures performance is always consistent. Additionally, these shocks are plug and play with the factory EDC system and retain all the functionally of the factory EDC system.

Set includes 2 front struts and 2 rear shocks to replace the original shocks on your BMW E46. The Bilstein Sport (SP) shock is designed for use with a shorter than stock spring (H&R, Eibach, etc). These shocks are shorter overall than the Bilstein HD or a stock shock to provide the correct amount of travel with a lowered or shorter spring. They also feature different bump stops and other hardware to account for the lowered ride height. These are about 20% firmer than a stock shock to provide improved handling and stability while not sacrificing ride comfort. A Sport shock is the perfect complement to a Sport spring because they are better matched to the new spring's ride height and spring rate than the original shock. They are firmer than the stock setting for more body control, better-managed weight transfer, less brake dive, and more overall stability. Bilstein's patented internal technology keeps the ride smooth and composed. You get a stiffer shock without the stiffer ride. Bilsteins are Made In Germany, road tested on the Autobahn, track tested on the Nurburgring, TUV-approved, and used in many Original Equipment applications (premium shocks on many vehicles).     These are the latest and current Bilstein design - not last year's model or old stock.  Price is for a set of 4.

You've found it. These rear shock mounts are designed for use on the track and racing. This set of mounts will help your rear shocks perform the best they can in those conditions. The advantage to using a mount with spherical bearing is that it allows the shock to freely move off axis without side loading the shock shaft like rubber or polyurethane mounts do. Side loading a shock increases friction and wear which decreases its efficiency.

This ECS rear shock mount combines the precision and articulation of a spherical bearing with the isolation of urethane bushings. The stainless monoball bearing is lined with PTFE lubricant and suspended in 80A urethane and housed in a hard anodized 6061-T6 aluminum mount. The spherical bearing is a better design than most rear shock mounts because it allows the shock to move and tilt without side-loading the shock shaft (which leads to premature failure of the shock). Most Genuine BMW and aftermarket shock mounts are not designed for shock angles and the stress that track or performance driving will put on the shock shaft. The ECS shock mount is properly designed to handle these loads. The internal bearing is also replaceable - it will be years before you have to replace the entire mount. The ECS mount is fully encapsulated to prevent the common shock mount failure of the stock mount design.

Little changed over the following two decades, and E36, E46, and Z3/Z4 models are also prone to this style of failure. After striking a pothole or another seemingly innocuous obstacle, a clunking from the rear emerges and handling becomes sloppy. Your shocks have blown through their mounts. Enter the Ultimate Performance Rear Shock Mount Kit from ECS Tuning. Not only does their industry-first design alleviate the blowout problem once and for all, but allows rear dampers to fully articulate, for the best possible damper performance and longevity. They accomplish this with no noticeable increase in noise, vibration, or harshness (NVH) thanks to their unique rebuildable polyurethane isolation. The poly bushings not only keep NVH to a minimum, but they also reduce impact loading on the bearing, improving bearing life over full solid mounted monoball designs. To further improve bearing life and longevity, this design incorporates a lower dust seal to keep road debris, grit, and other contaminants out of the bearing. These are one of the best rear shock mounts available, and the last you will ever need. Features: Maintenance-free, PTFE lined, stainless steel monoball spherical bearing for full shaft articulation Lower dust seal for improved bearing life 80A polyurethane isolation bushings for NVH control and improved bearing life Accommodates 10mm* Fully constrained shaft mount makes blowouts impossible Hard anodized 6061-T6 construction Class 10 black zinc plated studs New OEM lock nuts included Fully rebuildable design *For use with factory-style 10mm damper shafts. If you have factory-style mounts presently, you have 10mm damper shafts. *During installation a 17ft-lb torque spec is required to avoid damage to the mounts."

As these cars age, they require a number of suspension bushings to be replaced. Bushing replacement not only keeps the car in its top form, it also makes the car safer. Depending on the work, it may be logical to replace all of the bushings in the rear suspension (there are 19 total). This is especially true if you are pulling the subframe out to do the floor reinforcement or if you're doing a diff install. Turner Motorsport is a big believer in using rubber bushings for street cars (with the exception of solid subframe mounts, see further below). Urethanes, Delrin, or aluminum are generally good for reducing compliance and limiting deflection - attributes that don't really work well on roads filled with potholes, railroad crossings, cracks, and expansion joints. The rubber bushings maintain the factory ride/handling traits that won the E36 praise all over the world. Every bushing will need maintenance or replacement at some point and rubber has proven to last the longest and need less maintenance than anything else, even urethane. And unless competitive driving is your goal, the harder materials are only a gimmick."

IRP has created their pillow-ball rear shock mounts for just this need. These rear shock mounts are designed for use on the track and racing. This set of mounts will help your rear shocks perform the best they can in all conditions. The advantage to using a mount with spherical bearing is that it allows the shock to freely move off axis without side loading the shock shaft like rubber or polyurethane mounts do. Side loading a shock increases stiction and wear which decreases its efficiency. Because these are mounts without an isolator (rubber or polyurethane) to dampen road noise and vibrations we do not recommend them for street cars.

In some racing classes, it's necessary to not lower the suspension in order to meet the ride height requirements of that class. This means that your racing shocks may not be in their optimal range of travel and the shock will not allow enough droop in the suspension. As the inside tire lifts and the suspension droops, the shock becomes fully extended and actually ""tops out"" of its available travel. With the tire in the air your suspension, brakes, and differential cannot maximize adhesion to the race track, resulting in a large loss of lap time. These spacer blocks fit between the shock mount and the underside of the shock tower, pushing the shock down 20mm and restoring shock travel."

These rear shock mounts are designed for use on the track and racing. This set of mounts will help your rear shocks perform the best they can in those conditions. The advantage to using a mount with spherical bearing is that it allows the shock to freely move off axis without side loading the shock shaft like rubber or polyurethane mounts do. Side loading a shock increases friction and wear which decreases its efficiency. Because these are mounts without an isolator (rubber or polyurethane) to dampen road noise and vibrations we do not recommend them for street cars. These were designed in-house and developed based on our years of experience racing (and repairing) BMWs.

The bearing is there to allow the spring to rotate a little before going into a bind. If there are popping noises coming from the front strut it's probably because this bearing set is worn or missing. The bearing insert is a common wear item becoming noisy, gritty, or will just fail completely. You won't feel that they're bad from driving the car but you may hear clunking or popping sounds from the front struts. You can replace the rubber mounts on the car but don't leave this part out!

The shock mounts locate the front struts and rear shocks to the car - providing a quiet and vibration-free buffer between the road and the cabin. Shock mounts and bushings can wear out just like any other rubber part on the car. This leads to more noise and harshness reaching the chassis and may complicate your new suspension install. When installing new shocks, that is the perfect time to also replace the mounts. There is no additional time to install them, no special tools required, and doesn't take any extra time!

These rear shock mounts are designed for use on the track and racing. This set of mounts will help your rear shocks perform the best they can in those conditions. The advantage to using a mount with spherical bearing is that it allows the shock to freely move off axis without side loading the shock shaft like rubber or polyurethane mounts do. Side loading a shock increases friction and wear which decreases its efficiency. Because these are mounts without an isolator (rubber or polyurethane) to dampen road noise and vibrations we do not recommend them for street cars. These were designed in-house and developed based on our years of experience racing (and repairing) BMWs.

Set includes 2 front struts and 2 rear shocks to replace the original shocks on your BMW E46. The Bilstein Heavy Duty (HD) Shock is designed for use with stock springs (standard or E46 sport package). These shocks provide improved handling and stability without sacrificing ride comfort. Bilstein shocks make an excellent replacement shock for your worn out or tired original shocks. The Bilstein HD setting is a bit firmer than the stock setting for more body control, better-managed weight transfer, less brake dive, and more overall stability. Treat your suspension like a safety feature and use the Bilstein HD shocks. Bilstein's patented internal technology keeps the ride smooth and composed. You get a stiffer shock without the stiffer ride. Bilsteins are Made In Germany, road tested on the Autobahn, track tested on the Nurburgring, TUV-approved, and used in many Original Equipment applications (premium shocks on many vehicles).
