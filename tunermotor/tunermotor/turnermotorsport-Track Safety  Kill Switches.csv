      ...",557145,EL-28606,$44.45,"The Rennline 6 Pole Cut Off Switch is the same style used in the factory Porsche Cup Cars. It has been designed to eliminate the possibility of the alternator circuit being damaged due to a heavy voltage surge that can occur with the use of a heavy duty single circuit On/Off Switch. When turned to the off position the engine will be automatically stopped due to the secondary switch function whereby the ignition is cut. This prevents engine 'run on' and is a vital safety factor especially in competition use. This switch is also a very simple and effective anti theft device for cars, trucks, boats and Ag, vehicles."
