Supersprint performance exhaust adds more sound and substance to the ultra-quiet factory exhaust. Supersprint's exhaust philosophy is to make power without undue noise. They alter the size of the muffler, internal packaging, and piping sizes to extract more power while also delivering a refined and exotic sound. For the M2 they designed a raucous and throaty tone that leaves little doubt that this is a real M car. Like the stock system, there is only one muffler valve (on the driver side) but the sound remains aggressive in normal and Sport modes. This muffler is designed to fit only with a Supersprint section 2 pipe. The tips are polished, thin wall and angled 80mm stainless. Supersprint exhaust is widely recognized as the leader in complete exhaust system upgrades - extremely high quality, well designed for optimal flow, and amazing sound. Even at a premium price Supersprint is an unbeatable exhaust system because every aspect is done to such a high level. A Supersprint exhaust rewards you with a terrific sound, long lasting construction and excellent fitment. The Supersprint sound is very 'European' which fits the sporting sophistication of BMWs perfectly. Most systems are also modular - sections can be added or removed to custom tailor the exhaust sound to your preferance. Aside from 'Race' systems, their mufflers meet European noise laws so you get a refined and tuned sound without being excessively loud. Most Supersprint systems are built with larger diameter piping to improve exhaust flow which helps the engine do less work and make more horsepower! Supersprint exhausts generally run at a premium over other systems but no other system on the market can match their quality, performance, or reputation!

Supersprint performance exhaust adds more sound and substance to the ultra-quiet factory exhaust. Supersprint's exhaust philosophy is to make power without undue noise. They alter the size of the muffler, internal packaging, and piping sizes to extract more power while also delivering a refined and exotic sound. For the M2 they designed a raucous and throaty tone that leaves little doubt that this is a real M car. Like the stock system, there is only one muffler valve (on the driver side) but the sound remains aggressive in normal and Sport modes. This muffler is designed to fit only with a Supersprint section 2 pipe. The tips are polished, thin wall and angled 80mm stainless. Supersprint exhaust is widely recognized as the leader in complete exhaust system upgrades - extremely high quality, well designed for optimal flow, and amazing sound. Even at a premium price Supersprint is an unbeatable exhaust system because every aspect is done to such a high level.

The Supersprint sound is very 'European' which fits the sporting sophistication of BMWs perfectly. Most systems are also modular - sections can be added or removed to custom tailor the exhaust sound to your preferance.

This flow optimized exhaust system reduces exhaust backpressure and allows the M3’s 414 horsepower V8 engine to produce an even more powerful sound. Inconel’s unique qualities allowed engineers to reduce the thickness of the tubing from 1.5mm to 0.8mm. This resulted in a weight reduction of approximately 40%, or about 20 lbs. when compared to the stock exhaust system. Inconel has also proven to be very corrosion resistant and has been used at the highest level of Motorsports. The M Performance Exhaust includes perforated inner pipes and polished titanium tips, which are laser engraved with the M logo. It represents the ultimate in technology and sportiness, accentuating the individual character of the BMW M3. The exhaust was developed using state-of-the art CAD and FEM technology ensuring optimum fit and OEM quality.     2008+    M3 Sedan"

The V8 M3 sounds sooo nice with this exhaust you'll wonder why BMW didn't spec it like this from the beginning. They didn't because they needed to make sure it was quiet enough for everyone. But if you have felt the sound is too quiet and distant this is the perfect M3 exhaust upgrade. Of the three systems that Borla makes, this is the middle spec. Borla builds their exhaust with the goal of enhancing the sound - not just making it outrageously loud. In fact, Borla exhausts are some of the quietest and most pleasing sounds of all of the aftermarket brands we have seen. The M3 Borla produces a deep rumble perfectly suited to the V8. It's a throaty sound that any American muscle car fan will appreciate. Yet it manages to be civilized and unobstrusive when needed. This system slips on after the factory resonator section for an easy install. The Borla mufflers and pipes weigh in at only 34lbs - almost half the weight of the stock system - which helps performance in all areas.   Every Borla is made with 304 stainless steel for the internals and muffler body. Unlike other systems that can use coated aluminum, mild steel, or 409 stainless, the Borla uses true 304 stainless on the inside as well as the outside. This prevents the muffler from rusting and deteriorating from the inside out. Borla guarantees every muffler with a 1,000,000 mile warranty. Turner Motorsport has been the leading Borla dealer for BMW exhausts since we sold our first system in 1996, including using Borla Exhausts on every Turner BMW racecar.     2008-2013    M3 coupe"

Their ATAK system -   costically   uned   pplied   inetics - allows a very high volume without drone and distortion. This is beyond your the usual 'muscle car' sound - this is full blown automotive thunder! Borla manages the sound waves inside the exhaust to produce an exhaust note that maintains its tone as revs rise. With ATAK, the sound output is tuned like a graphic equalizer to shape and focus sound waves for optimum high-volume output. This exclusive technology produces the highest available dB (decibel) levels in the Borla street-legal lineup, and is designed for high-performance purists who prefer exhaust notes over their stereos. For an exhaust that really emphasizes the M3's motorsport background this is THE exhaust system.    Every Borla is made with 304 stainless steel for the internals and muffler body. Unlike other systems that can use coated aluminum, mild steel, or 409 stainless, the Borla uses true 304 stainless on the inside as well as the outside. This prevents the muffler from rusting and deteriorating from the inside out. Borla guarantees every muffler with a 1,000,000 mile warranty. Turner Motorsport has been the leading Borla dealer for BMW exhausts since we sold our first system in 1996, including using Borla Exhausts on every Turner BMW racecar.     2008-2012    M3 coupe  2008-2012    M3 cabrio"
