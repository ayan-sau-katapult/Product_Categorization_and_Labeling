The problem is worsened with higher boost levels.

We're seeing a lot more 135 and 335 cars with drivability and performance issues because oil has sneaked by the ring seals and is coating the intake piping, intercooler, intake valves, and other critical areas. The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance.

Each baffle is precision laser cut from .090"" heat-treated aluminum then hand-assembled and test fit to ensure accuracy and ease of installation. Achilles Motorsports' baffle design incorporates dual trap doors and a unique oil deflector that prevents oil from splashing out of the sump under hard braking. Together, these help minimize the sloshing of the oil inside the oil pan and keep oil accumulated around your pickup tube. The factory BMW oil pan doesn't do a very good job of keeping oil accumulated around the oil pick-up tube in high g-force situations. By keeping oil accumulated around the pickup tube you can eliminate the costly loss of oil pressure and potential damage to other vital engine parts commonly caused by high g-forces from hard acceleration and braking and high-speed cornering. Professional welding is required for installation! During installation, while the oil pan is removed, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND upgrading your factory oil pump with the Achilles Motorsport Upgraded Oil Pump Shaft Kit (T#1150772). After numerous instances of sheered-off oil pump shafts and oil pump nuts coming loose, resulting in an instant loss of oil pressure, Achilles decided to come up with a solution - Don't let it happen to you!"

The existing stock system does a very poor job of separating fluid and vapor and this leads to an oily film or even small pools of oil throughout the turbos and intake. We're seeing a lot more 135 and 335 cars with drivability and performance issues because oil has sneaked by the ring seals and is coating the intake piping, intercooler, intake valves, and other critical areas. The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance. Our own shop has gone the extra step and offers media blasting of the intake valves to strip away the oily buildup we have seen.Our shop also strongly recommends an oil catch can be installed in the line for the crankcase vent. The oil catch can traps oil as it leaves the valve cover and holds it in a canister. Whatever minimal vapors are left over in the oil is then vented back through the canister and into the intake where it is safe to be burned up in the engine or recirculated back through the system again. This is the way the system was designed! At each oil change simply unscrew the canister and empty the trapped oil with your regular used oil. A dipstick is integrated into the cap so you can monitor the oil level. Installing one of these will avoid costly repairs in the future and help maintain your boost and performance. It's one of the smartest modifications you can make because it demonstrates a well-thought out tuning strategy and care for the condition of your engine.The ECS Oil Catch Can is made from aluminum and with a stealthy black anodized finish. Multiple brackets are available so you're not limited on where to mount it. The location is key as heat will evaporate the oil and send too much vapor back into the engine (where cooler air will turn it back into fluid). The ECS OCC also has a factory-like appearance.Note: Since the crankcase vent system is considered part of the overall emissions system, installing this may be a violation of local, state, and federal laws. While exemptions are made for track/race and off-road use, check with your local state inspection facility on using this in street-driven vehicles."

The TMS oil cooler lines now sit safely away from any moving parts like pulleys and serpentine belts. Our lines are made from HTP (High Temperature Polymer Braided), a synthetic line with multiple advantages over rubber or stainless lines.   We picked HTP lines for four reasons:  1) it insulates the oil from heat better than rubber or stainless lines,  2) the hose can hold a tighter bend radius without crimping or restricting oil flow, which makes routing the oil lines easier and more versatile,  3) the HTP line are less abrasive than stainless steel braided lines so they won�t rub through your factory power steering lines or any other rubber hose on the car,  4) weight savings � even if it is not much remember it all adds up.        1992-1999    323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3"

The Achilles Motorsports Oil Pan Baffle was designed and manufactured to be used on racing, high-performance track, and street driven cars. Each baffle is precision laser cut from .090"" heat-treated aluminum then hand-assembled and test fit to ensure accuracy and ease of installation. Achilles Motorsports' baffle design incorporates dual trap doors and a unique oil deflector that prevents oil from splashing out of the sump under hard braking. Together, these help minimize the sloshing of the oil inside the oil pan and keep oil accumulated around your pickup tube. The factory BMW oil pan doesn't do a very good job of keeping oil accumulated around the oil pick-up tube in high g-force situations. By keeping oil accumulated around the pickup tube you can eliminate the costly loss of oil pressure and potential damage to other vital engine parts commonly caused by high g-forces from hard acceleration and braking and high-speed cornering. Professional welding is required for installation! For use with BMW oil pan: 11131432703 During installation, while the oil pan is removed, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND upgrading your factory oil pump with the Achilles Motorsport Upgraded Oil Pump Shaft Kit (T#1150773). After numerous instances of sheered-off oil pump shafts and oil pump nuts coming loose, resulting in an instant loss of oil pressure, Achilles decided to come up with a solution - Don't let it happen to you!"

The existing stock system does a very poor job of separating fluid and vapor and this leads to an oily film or even small pools of oil throughout the turbos and intake. We're seeing a lot more 135 and 335 cars with drivability and performance issues because oil has sneaked by the ring seals and is coating the intake piping, intercooler, intake valves, and other critical areas. The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance. Our own shop has gone the extra step and offers media blasting of the intake valves to strip away the oily buildup we have seen."

The intent behind this design was to offer the most effective oil/air separation while being incredibly easy to maintain. The included drain kit allows you to route the drain hose to a mounted location near the belly pan of the vehicle making it convenient to empty at oil change intervals. Modern-day emissions regulations require the use of a closed crankcase ventilation (PCV) system to recirculate combustion blow-by gases from the crankcase back into the intake to be burned. Unfortunately, these blow-by gases contain water vapor (which is a byproduct of combustion) and pick up oil mist from and the windage cloud and cam lubrication system as they travel through the crankcase. Due to less than 100% effective air/oil separation in the stock PCV system, some oil mist and water vapor gets carried back to the intake tract and over time causes oil deposits in the intake manifold, intake ports, and on the back of the intake valves. All will eventually lead to poor performance and reduced fuel economy, and the presence of this oil mist in the intake charge may even increase the risk of engine-damaging detonation. With forced induction, track use, and/or extended high RPM usage, these symptoms increase as the factory PCV system is overwhelmed, and a catch can becomes a must for your N20 powered BMW. Features: 6061-T6 billet machined body, anodized black for lasting protection and appearance Strategically positioned 4 chamber baffle system maximizes oil/air separation Knurled and black anodized oil dipstick makes inspecting oil volume of reservoir clean and simple Sealed with a pre-installed o-ring Includes 2.5mm Allen key to remove baffle plates for cleaning Engineered to create multiple changes in the direction of airflow within the separator to cause oil droplets to fall out of suspension before exiting the catch can Closed/recirculated design reduces oil ingestion and promotes cleaner emissions and odor-less operation Valved drainage system - no removal of can necessary to empty"

Each baffle is precision laser cut from .090"" heat-treated aluminum then hand-assembled and test fit to ensure accuracy and ease of installation. Achilles Motorsports' baffle design incorporates dual trap doors and a unique oil deflector that prevents oil from splashing out of the sump under hard braking. Together, these help minimize the sloshing of the oil inside the oil pan and keep oil accumulated around your pickup tube. The factory BMW oil pan doesn't do a very good job of keeping oil accumulated around the oil pick-up tube in high g-force situations. By keeping oil accumulated around the pickup tube you can eliminate the costly loss of oil pressure and potential damage to other vital engine parts commonly caused by high g-forces from hard acceleration and braking and high-speed cornering.

Everything we send you bolts or clips into place with no modification necessary and all hardware is included, making this an ideal kit for a street/track car.

Original BMW oil cooler (from Euro E36 M3), BMW oil cooler lines (rubber lines with metal fittings), a BMW oil filter housing (properly modified to accept the US banjo-style fitting of the VAN0S oil line), and brackets to mount the cooler to the bottom of the stock radiator.   This oil cooler system incorporates the Euro M3 oil filter housing. This Euro filter housing has ports for the delivery and return lines of the oil cooler. The internal pathways of the filter housing are designed for the oil to flow out of the housing, into the cooler, and then back to the housing to pass through the filter. Also the Euro housing has an integrated thermostat to bypass the cooler at lower temps (who needs cold oil when the engine is cold?). The US housing is not setup for any of this as the oil just runs straight into the filter and onto the engine. Using this housing also allows the use of the factory euro oil cooler lines, and is a direct fit with a minor modification that we make in-house. Other kits that are on the market don�t have this modification or have a �quick fix� solution which can open up the possibility of leaks or oil starvation. We don�t take shortcuts so our products are engineered to work as a complete system � no leaks, no fitment problems, and superior performance.      due to clearance issues with the oil lines. This kit WILL work fine with our TMS pulley kits. For cars with forced induction, turbo, supercharger, or racing alternator pulleys, we recommend our Stage II or Stage III kits, which provide more flexible/universal routing of oil cooler lines, as well as larger oil cooler (Stage III)."

This is the same housing as used in our Stage I, Stage II, and Stage III oil cooler kits.     The Euro E36 M3 cars use a different VAN0S system and the VAN0S oil line is a different size. The banjo bolt on the US car is M14x1.5 thread and the housing is drilled and tapped using a jig on a machine � not by hand � so the outside surface of the flange is smooth and flat to prevent leaks. This allows this filter housing to be used on US spec M3's, as well as any non-M E36 6 cylinder BMW.   Using this to install an oil cooler? Be sure to consult us.

BMW began replacing traditional style dipsticks with new level sensors that display your oil level on your iDrive system. In theory, this could be great. An electrical, sensor-based oil level system would allow for continuous monitoring of the oil level and immediate warning in the event of oil loss. The main problem with this updated system is the sensors themselves and the sub-par electronics that control and report this information to the iDrive system. In practice, the oil level sensors have proven to be slow, inaccurate, and even faulty, displaying wildly inaccurate measurements. Needless to say, the team over at Bimmerworld felt this needed to be addressed with something a little more reliable.

We have solved that problem by assembling this kit with a much larger Fluidyne oil cooler, our own special-length oil cooler lines, and the Turner Motorsport Oil Line Fitting Kit. The Fluidyne oil cooler has more surface area and holds more oil than the original. This not only ensures the oil is cooled better but also that hot oil is circulated through the system less often (less heatsoak of the oil). With this kit on our SCCA T2 M3 we never had oil temp issues, even after two seasons of National and Runoff races. The cooler can fit in the factory location for a safe and clean appearance, however, brackets must be fabricated by your installer. The lines are custom made to our spec with extra strength braided steel with a Teflon outer coating and -10 AN fittings. The lines attach to the stock oil filter housing with our Oil Line Fitting Kit and o-rings are included. The length of the lines also makes them compatible with most supercharger kits (with custom brackets you can mount the oil cooler so that nothing on the cooler or the supercharger needs to be modified for fitment).   Fitment note: due to the various uses and locations available, brackets are not included with the oil cooler. Hanger brackets will need to be fabricated to mount the oil cooler to the car.     2001-2006    M3"

The existing stock system does a very poor job of separating fluid and vapor and this leads to an oily film or even small pools of oil throughout the turbos and intake. We're seeing a lot more 135 and 335 cars with drivability and performance issues because oil has sneaked by the ring seals and is coating the intake piping, intercooler, intake valves, and other critical areas. The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance. Our own shop has gone the extra step and offers media blasting of the intake valves to strip away the oily buildup we have seen. We have only seen serious blow-by issues on the N54 engines but that shouldn't stop someone from adding a OCC to an N55 engine as well.   Our shop also strongly recommends an oil catch can be installed in the line for the crankcase vent. The oil catch can traps oil as it leaves the valve cover and holds it in a canister. This catch can is located in a cool spot of the engine bay where the oil will condense easier and stay in the can. Whatever minimal vapors are left over in the oil is then vented back through the canister and into the intake where it is safe to be burned up in the engine or recirculated back through the system again. This is the way the system was designed! At each oil change simply unscrew the canister and empty the trapped oil with your regular used oil. The Burger Tuning oil catch can is the best we have seen so far. Installing one of these will avoid costly repairs in the future and help maintain your boost and performance. It's one of the smartest modifications you can make because it demonstrates a well-thought out tuning strategy and care for the condition of your engine.   The BMS Oil Catch Can is made from aluminum and with a stealthy black anodized finish. It installs on the passenger side of the engine with a dedicated bracket and new oversized vent lines. This gives it a factory-like appearance. Since BMS designed their catch can from scratch they can guarantee it fits and performs correctly for the N54/N55 engine, unlike other catch cans on the market that are poorly retrofitted from other applications and under-sized for the N54/N55 engine.   Note: Since the crankcase vent system is considered part of the overall emissions system, installing this may be a violation of local, state, and federal laws. While exemptions are made for track/race and off-road use, check with your local state inspection facility on using this in street-driven vehicles.     + Increases air intake efficiency  + Promotes engine longevity  + Double-baffled design allows excellent air/oil separation  + Large In/Out ports (no tapered sizes that slow flow)  + Stealth mounting on cooler side of engine bay (promotes condensation of oil to vapor)  + Anodized black lightweight aluminum  + N55 version mounts out of sight under the radiator support  + Made in USA with a lifetime guarantee     2011-2013    BMW 135i  2011-2013    BMW 335i 335xi"

The existing stock system does a very poor job of separating fluid and vapor and this leads to an oily film or even small pools of oil throughout the turbos and intake. We're seeing a lot more 135 and 335 cars with drivability and performance issues because oil has sneaked by the ring seals and is coating the intake piping, intercooler, intake valves, and other critical areas. The problem is worsened with higher boost levels. Oil is excellent for lubricating moving parts but terrible when it gets into the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the octane rating and reducing performance. Our own shop has gone the extra step and offers media blasting of the intake valves to strip away the oily buildup we have seen.Our shop also strongly recommends an oil catch can be installed in the line for the crankcase vent. The oil catch can traps oil as it leaves the valve cover and holds it in a canister. This catch can is located on the cooler side of the engine where the oil will condense easier and stay in the can. Whatever minimal vapors are left over in the oil is then vented back through the canister and into the intake where it is safe to be burned up in the engine or recirculated back through the system again. This is the way the system was designed! At each oil change simply unscrew the canister and empty the trapped oil with your regular used oil. The Burger Tuning oil catch can is the best we have seen so far. Installing one of these will avoid costly repairs in the future and help maintain your boost and performance. It's one of the smartest modifications you can make because it demonstrates a well-thought out tuning strategy and care for the condition of your engine.The BMS Oil Catch Can is made from aluminum and with a stealthy black anodized finish. It installs on the cooler side of the engine with a dedicated bracket and new oversized vent lines. The location is key as heat will evaporate the oil and send too much vapor back into the engine (where cooler air will turn it back into fluid). The BMS OCC also has a factory-like appearance. Since BMS designed their catch can from scratch they can guarantee it fits and performs correctly for the N54/N55 engine, unlike other catch cans on the market that are poorly retrofitted from other applications and under-sized for the N54 engine.Note: Since the crankcase vent system is considered part of the overall emissions system, installing this may be a violation of local, state, and federal laws. While exemptions are made for track/race and off-road use, check with your local state inspection facility on using this in street-driven vehicles"

The Euro housing has ports on it for running the Euro oil cooler. It also has an internal oil thermostat that will divert oil back through the block to warm it faster when the engine is cold. This housing is commonly used in the US with the Euro oil cooler when properly modified. The port for the VAN0S needs to be drilled and tapped to match the US VAN0S line and banjo bolt (M14x1.5). We can modify the housing for you (select this option from the list) or you can have it done locally (DIY modification is not recommended).

Over time, the transmission fluid becomes thick and the filter becomes contaminated with small metal particles. This can cause excess wear, high transmission operating temperatures, and eventual failure. To prevent this we recommend changing your filter, fluid, and seals to ensure your transmission continues to operate flawlessly. We recommend filter and fluid changes every 50,000 miles. This filter fits GA6HP19Z automatic transmissions. This will NOT fit the GA6L45R transmission. Please check your transmission to ensure it is the correct type.
