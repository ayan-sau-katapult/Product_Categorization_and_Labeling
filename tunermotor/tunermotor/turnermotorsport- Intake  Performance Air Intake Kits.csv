Like all of our Turner Motorsport products, our N55 intake was CAD Designed in-house to give you the best performing, most beautiful intake we could possibly imagine for your N55 powered BMW. The best part? Our design seamlessly integrates with OEM ducting and stock mounting locations to give you a simple install and an OEM+ fit and finish. We believe this is the way the N55 engine bays should have come from the factory. It’s time to ditch all that plastic. Our higher flow filter and intake design gave our F30 335i an additional 7 WHP and 14 ft-lbs of torque over stock when we tested on our dyno. Our less restrictive intake design reduced post filter pressure by 0.2 psi over stock, allowing for gains across the entire RPM range - this reduced pressure drop also results in less stress on your N55’s turbo. We offer our N55 carbon intake in either gloss or matte finish, so you can choose what best suits your engine bay. Select either gloss or matte finish below, and then please select whether or not you are purchasing an intake for a manual transmission vehicle. If your vehicle has a manual transmission, it will require BMW Part # 13907515387. If you are looking for our Turner Motorsport Enclosed Carbon Intake, see T#568148. Note that we only offer Open intakes for F87 M2.

A word that perfectly encapsulates the mindset of Eventuri. Performance parts with obsessive attention to detail and an unyielding dedication to quality. Perfectly designed to maximize the potential of each individual vehicle and meticulously refined through rigorous testing. Eventuri offers a product that stands in a class of its own and delivers outstanding power increases without making false claims or exaggerating dyno numbers. With patented designs such as a custom velocity stack filter housing and improved ducting that guides the flow of air into the engine, to the breathtaking uniformity of the weave pattern. These are performance products for the truly discerning customer. When it comes to styling a vehicle the proper look is one that complements, not cheapens the inherent design. Race-inspired carbon fiber completes the look and style of every BMW M-powered model and Eventuri delivers on an entirely new level. Performance increase = 10-15hp, 8-12ft-lb The E46 M3 intake system is a result of extensive data logging, dyno testing, and design optimization. The aim was to develop an intake system for the S54 engine which worked with the stock ECU map and MAF sensor and produced a genuine improvement in the driving experience. The E46 M3 Eventuri system uses a Patent Pending Carbon fiber Housing which provides an aerodynamically efficient airflow path from the filter to the MAF tube. Not just another cone filter with a heat shield but a unique design that invokes the Venturi affect. Made from 100% prepreg carbon fiber of the highest quality, the workmanship on the housing is second to none. This encapsulates the filter and is mated to an anodized aluminum inlet cowl to ensure a smooth inlet flow path. The filter itself is a deep pleated, high flow double-cone configuration that is dry to avoid damaging the MAF sensor. Finally, the assembly is then mated to an aluminum heat shield which effectively shrouds the intake from engine bay heat and captures the ambient air being diverted from the scoop. Also, notice the rubber spacer on the mount of the heat shield - this is for the headlight module to sit on so that it remains at the right height - small details are important! 100% Prepreg carbon fibre with a CNC machined collar - the air scoop forces ambient air directly into the filter opening. This scoop simply clicks into place in the front right-hand brake duct and effectively saturates the mouth of the intake with cold air. It has been designed to take up half the height of the duct in order to allow airflow to still continue through the duct for the brakes. The scoop is so effective that even after a hard drive, the aluminum cowl at the mouth of the intake will still feel cold to touch! Each kit consists of: 100% Prepreg Carbon Fibre Intake Housing Anodised Aluminium inlet cowling High Flow Filter CNC Machined MAF tube 100% Prepreg Carbon Fibre Air Scoop with CNC machined aluminum collar 3 Aluminum heat shields with neoprene lining High-quality Silicon coupler with BMW specification hose clamps This kit fits the following BMWs: ​2001 - 2006 E46 M3"

The stock E9x M3 intake is very well designed from the factory, offering a great flow path and feed system for air - it wasn't easy to improve upon, but Eventuri made it happen. Eventuri found restrictions in the inlet tube that connects the airbox to the inlet manifold on the S65 engine. They redesigning the tube and maintained the airbox, allowing the German V8 engine to breathe more efficiently and put down some substantial power gains. In addition to the new tube design, Eventuri also optimized a restriction in the air feed system by designing a scoop that allows increased airflow through the airbox, reducing inlet temperature values putting down more GAINS."

By redesigning the tube yet maintaining the airbox, we have been able to allow the V8 engine to breathe with greater efficiency and therefore gain power.

Set a new benchmark for intake design providing true gains, not just ""claims."" Designed to use the ""venturi effect,"" Eventuri has created a unique intake system that out-performs the competition. The Venturi effect is when the smooth reduction in cross-sectional area along the length of the housing causes the airflow to increase in velocity. This means more air-flow and smoother delivery, resulting in more power. But that isn't all that sets their design apart. They also use an inverted cone filter that is decoupled from the MAF. This is done because it means the filter no longer dictates the shape of air-flow, thus creating the venturi effect. Their systems are extensively developed using cutting edge design, testing and prototyping methods. With a focus on performance, each design undergoes CFD analysis and is then validated at the prototype stage through volumetric airflow, intake temperature and extensive dyno testing. They strive to publish all the development information to illustrate the depths they go in bringing an intake from concept to reality. Also assuring to only use the highest quality components for style and durability Each Intake system includes: 2 Carbon Fiber Venturi housings 2 High Flow Double Cone Air Filters 2 Aluminium Cowls for smooth airflow entry Left Side Carbon Tube with integrated MAF sensor mount Right Side Carbon Tube with integrated MAF sensor mount 2 Carbon Fiber Front Scoops 2 Laser Cut Aluminium Shields with integrated flow deflectors High quality Silicon couplers with BMW specification hose clamps This part fits the following vehicles: 2010 - 2016 F10 M5"

Heat and Volume are the main considerations when designing an intake for turbocharged engines. In the G20, the intake system is located next to the exhaust manifold which rapidly heat soaks the engine bay. High temperatures are detrimental for engine performance as the turbo would have to build boost with heated, less dense air and so the only way to ensure IAT’s are kept to a minimum is for a fully sealed intake. This however, results in a restriction with only one stock air feed to draw air in from. During development, the folks at Eventuri noticed an additional opening into the wheel arch area and took advantage of this by adding a secondary feed to our airbox. Furthermore, the sealed airbox also has a heat shield with gold reflective to minimise the radiative heat transfer from the exhaust manifold. In order to maximize volume, they made the airbox as large as possible with a recess for potential strut braces. The stock convoluted intake tube is replaced with a smooth carbon tube which is also larger in internal volume with a starting internal diameter of 111mm (4.4') smoothly tapering down to match the turbo inlet. The tube provides a smooth path from the filter to the turbo inlet. Finally, they use a custom-made high-flow dry filter that is ISO tested for filtration performance and has a larger filtration area than the stock filter."

Heat and Volume are the main considerations when designing an intake for turbocharged engines. In the G20, the intake system is located next to the exhaust manifold which rapidly heat soaks the engine bay. High temperatures are detrimental for engine performance as the turbo would have to build boost with heated, less dense air and so the only way to ensure IAT’s are kept to a minimum is for a fully sealed intake. This however, results in a restriction with only one stock air feed to draw air in from. During development, the folks at Eventuri noticed an additional opening into the wheel arch area and took advantage of this by adding a secondary feed to our airbox. Furthermore, the sealed airbox also has a heat shield with gold reflective to minimise the radiative heat transfer from the exhaust manifold. In order to maximize volume, they made the airbox as large as possible with a recess for potential strut braces. The stock convoluted intake tube is replaced with a smooth carbon tube which is also larger in internal volume with a starting internal diameter of 111mm (4.4') smoothly tapering down to match the turbo inlet. The tube provides a smooth path from the filter to the turbo inlet. Finally, they use a custom-made high-flow dry filter that is ISO tested for filtration performance and has a larger filtration area than the stock filter."

Dinan studied the aerodynamics and packaging of the front end to determine where additional intakes can take in air. New airbox covers incorporate carbon fiber air ducts that run to the top of the radiator support where it gets a ram-air effect from the front grilles. The new airbox cover and piping are designed with a composite material that blocks hot air. A K&N high flow air filter that has 77% more surface area than stock sits in the new airbox. Dinan has shown peak gains of 13hp and 9ft-lbs of torque from the intake alone but greater gains come at higher RPM where more airflow is required.

The E9X stock airbox system is a brilliantly designed intake with an excellent flow path and feed system for ambient air. However, on closer inspection, there are restrictions in the inlet tube connecting the airbox to the inlet manifold. By redesigning the tube yet maintaining the airbox, we have been able to allow the V8 engine to breathe with greater efficiency and therefore gain power. In addition to the new tube design, we also identified a further restriction in the air feed system. To overcome this we designed a scoop to allow an increase in airflow through the airbox. This reduces inlet temperature values further and adds to the performance gain of the system."

In stock trim, the M340i comes with a dry and lifeless airbox housing a basic panel filter that is also accompanied by an intake resonator whose job is to eliminate turbo/intake noises. The same noises that those in the performance world relish. Essentially BMW has seen fit to give M340i owners an airbox that looks uninspiring, flows adequately but not ideally, and emits no noise. The exact opposite of what the platform exudes otherwise. The Dinan carbon fiber intake for the platform rights these wrongs and delivers a semi-open intake capable of flowing 58% more air than the stock system resulting in additional top-end power and increased throttle response. At the same time revealing a more aggressive, sporty carbon fiber appearance, and an increase in sound courtesy of the removal of the intake resonator and implementation of a semi-open design. In order to achieve the gains in flow that set the Dinan intake system apart, the entire lower box of the system, and not just the lid, has been reworked and enlarged in an effort to make use of as much of the available real estate as possible within the engine bay. In turn, this allows a 40% larger, custom, free-flowing filter to be housed within and maximum flow to be realized. However, a secondary inlet has always been desired by Dinan in order to effectively fill the volume of the enlarged airbox and increased filter surface area. This desire led to a multitude of experiments being conducted on the effectiveness of a possible open-air inlet in the system. With different shapes, locations, and sizes of openings being tested, the goal was to ensure that the added secondary inlet did not cause any unwarranted side effects such as an increase in air temps in the system. This is commonplace with open-air intake systems where overheated engine bay air is employed in the intake tract. The results of these tests showed that the patterned openings present in the final iteration of the box located on the opposite side from the engine provided a perfect balance of additional volume to assist the factory inlet all the while not causing an increase in turbo inlet temperatures. This was the case regardless of testing conditions (single/multiple gear pulls, constant speed, 0-100mph runs, etc.). With more air being pulled into the system, throttle response is improved and additional power is realized in the form of max gains of +9 WHP / +8 ft-lbs of torque. The secondary air inlets also allow the intake system to be more audible so the turbo spool and BOV can be appreciated. A stark difference from Dinan's traditional fully sealed systems where induction noise is not nearly as recognizable. Not to be outdone by the increased power and sound, the outwardly visible system is made of immaculate carbon fiber so the under the hood appeal is vastly improved over its drab and utilitarian beginnings. A worthy piece to add to an already impressive vehicle. Features: More Power: Max gains of 9 WHP and 8 lb-ft of torque @ 6500 RPM on a completely stock vehicle. Enjoyably louder, sportier sound. Improved throttle response Outflows factory intake by 58% or more. Larger volume airbox (60% larger than stock). 40% increase in filter area (stock: 82 in², Dinan: 115 in²) for optimum flow.

But it's easy to take things too far and become ""boost drunk"". If what you're after is a generous bump in power without worrying about reliability, compromises, or additional modifications the aFe Power Scorcher is perfect for you. We've tried the Scorcher in a number of different BMWs and can report back that it works flawlessly! This module is paired with the Momentum GT air intake system and restore kit to allow for as much airflow as possible.The Scorcher is a plug-and-play tuning module that installs on the engine wiring harness and modifies the signals from the manifold pressure sensors. The new signals are then sent to the engine computer which increases boost based on the modified signal. The power gains are instantly noticeable and the module has been fully engineered to deliver a smooth and reliable power boost over all RPM. aFe developed this module upgrade on their in-house Mustang and Dynojet dynos. There are other products that give more power (for additional cost and complexity) but more boost also brings more complications. This is all of the power you need without additional drama and trickery. The Scorcher can be used on its own or combined with other aFe Power products for the total package. The install is very easy with no cutting or modification to existing components. Unplug the harness from your MAP sensors and plug it into the Scorcher module. Then plug the Scorcher harness into the MAP sensors. Mount the module wherever you wish (Velcro and zip ties included). A blue LED lets you know the module is plugged in correctly and functioning. You can also revert back to stock just as easily! The Scorcher is built with a 0.1% tolerance on critical components. Each connector is an OE type for the best and most secure fitment and they use high quality wiring with excellent heat and chemical resistance. The module box is aluminum with a hardcoat anodize finish. This is way beyond the other 'resistor in a box' products on the market. aFe warranties the complete unit for two years."

Up to ~2018/2019 Check MAF Sensor as this Pre LCI has a Oval base design sensor part for the mount to the tube housing Designed to use the ""venturi effect,"" Eventuri has created a unique intake system that out-performs the competition. The Venturi effect is when the smooth reduction in cross-sectional area along the length of the housing causes the airflow to increase in velocity. This means more air-flow and smoother delivery, resulting in more power. But that isn't all that sets their design apart. They also use an inverted cone filter that is decoupled from the MAF. This is done because it means the filter no longer dictates the shape of air-flow, thus creating the venturi effect. The F56 MINI Eventuri intake system is another example of our “Complete System” principal. It is a sealed system which ensures that the turbo does not draw hot air from the engine bay but enhanced with a functional bonnet scoop which forces ambient air into the intake duct. This duct has a larger internal volume than the stock version and also draws air from the stock location above the radiator. The combination of a sealed system with an air scoop results in lower intake temperatures than the stock airbox and avoids heat soak which is a common issue especially on higher powered MINIs. To ensure the smoothest flow possible we use our Patented filter housing coupled with a CNC machined MAF tube to ensure the smoothest possible flow to the turbo."

It is a sealed system that ensures the turbo does not draw hot air from the engine bay but enhanced with a functional bonnet scoop which forces ambient air into the intake duct. This duct has a larger internal volume than the stock version and also draws air from the stock location above the radiator. The combination of a sealed system with an air scoop results in lower intake temperatures than the stock airbox and avoids heat soak which is a common issue especially on higher powered MINIs. To ensure the smoothest flow possible, Eventuri uses its Patented Venturi filter housing which has an integrated MAF section for a seamless flow path to the turbo. The filter housing comprises Eventuri's bespoke Generation 2 filter, aluminum inlet cowl, stainless steel bracket, and the integrated MAF section. The carbon pod shrouds the reverse mounted filter and smoothly shapes the airflow down to the MAF section which then connects to the stock inlet tube. This changes the flow path from the OEM airbox where airflow enters the front of the airbox, changes direction by 90 degrees to travel through the panel filter, and then changes direction again by 90 degrees to move through the MAF section. Eventuri's system is a lot more direct with airflow entering the front of the filter housing and moving into the MAF section without any abrupt direction changes. The result is a smoother path from the filter to the turbo inlet tube and therefore the turbo is able to function with less drag. The OEM intake system draws in air from behind the front grill, above the radiator. The openings for the intake of ambient air are relatively small and therefore can lead to heat soak of the intake especially on a tuned Mini. The OEM bonnet scoop does not provide air directly to the intake and since the bonnet already has 2 cut-outs under the scoop, Eventuri decided to utilize this feature and redevelop the scoop. Their scoop is a direct replacement of the OEM part and clicks into place using the same fastening method. It features 2 inlet ramps that guide external air through the existing cut-outs on the bonnet and into the inlet duct. As the car speeds up, more air is forced into the duct keeping inlet temperatures to a minimum and avoiding the heat soak issue. The scoop has a redesigned profile with a longer top surface to cover the openings which also provides a more aggressive look. Crafted from 100% prepreg carbon fiber, the scoop provides an incredible aesthetic to the vehicle. To further enhance the aesthetic feature - Eventuri used a V-shaped split weave with the carbon to give a symmetrical profile which works well as the scoop sits in the middle of the bonnet. ​The F5X JCW Eventuri system uses their Patented Carbon fiber Housing which provides an aerodynamically efficient airflow path from the filter to the turbo. Not just another cone filter with a heat shield but a unique design that invokes the Venturi effect and maintains laminar flow conditions to reduce the drag on the turbo.
