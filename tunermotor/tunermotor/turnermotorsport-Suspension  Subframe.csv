Designed and manufactured by TMS using knowledge from many years of successful professional racing in Grand-Am Sports Car Challenge, SCCA Speed World Challenge, BMW Club, and SCCA club racing.   A BMW's rear subframe is the heart of the suspension. When the subframe moves, so do all the suspension mounting points. Replacing the stock rubber bushings with solid ones limits both drivetrain and suspension movement, eliminating the unwanted movement and keeping your BMW's setup the way it should be. These solid mounts will also help prevent the subframe from tearing out of the chassis on your E90/E92 3 series. We spend lots of extra time machining each TMS subframe mount to keep your car as light as possible. CNC machined from high grade billet aluminum for precision and quality. These solid aluminum subframe bushings are for racing applications only, and can be used on all E90 M3 & E92 M3.      2011-2012    1M  2008-2012    M3 - Sedan  2008-2012    M3 - Coupe  2008-2012    M3 - Convertible"

...",1452,TDR9080SS3,$283.45,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-600-bmw-subframe#,A BMWs sub-frame is the heart of the suspension - as the subframe twists and shifts under load all of the suspension mounting points also move. The rear suspension feels loose and lacks precision. As rubber or hydroelastic bushings wear the bushing deflection gets worse. If you have a highly tuned 335i/xi you're putting even more strain on weak bushings. The solution is a stiffer and more durable material. Even BMW has moved to solid mounts on the F10 M5 and F8X M3/M4. These fully solid E82/E90/E92 aluminum mounts have zero deflection - the subframe does not move at all. The rest of the suspension can work as designed and maintain the proper alignment and motion ratios. The driver will notice the difference as the car is more stable and the handling is more precise.

While OE rubber bushings are fine when they are new from the factory, aged and worn out rubber bushings create a multitude of issues that can range from annoying to dangerous. As a factory bushing ages, it begins to harden and become brittle. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point. At this point, the differential is free to shift under load causing a noticeable clunking noise under acceleration and deceleration and massively increasing the stress on the driveshaft and axles. Manual transmissions suffer the worst from this as it can make shifting difficult since the differential will shift when the clutch is engaged and disengaged."

Not only do all of the suspension arms attach to it, the driveline runs through it via the differential and half-shafts. Therefore, a track-prepped E46 should never see any flex or deflection in any of the subframe mounts. Excessive movement here transfers to unwanted suspension motions elsewhere and is also a major contributor to failures in the rear floor sheetmetal.   While our Delrin-Aluminum subframe mounts conform to various racing series these all-aluminum mounts are the ultimate in reducing flex and deflection. The rubber stock mounts, and the Delrin mounts to a small degree, flex and deflect as various forces are applied throughout the subframe - on and off throttle loading, cornering on flat surfaces, bumpy surfaces, weight transfer, sticky race tires, etc. Too much flex from worn rubber mounts will transfer to flex where the subframe meets the chassis/floor. This is the primary cause for the infamous rear subframe failure. These fully solid aluminum mounts have absolutely zero flex to them so they will not contribute to rear subframe issues. The Turner E46 Reinforcement Kit is still recommended.   These solid subframe mounts were designed for racing use only, where we won several sports car championships in the Grand-Am Cup series. These subframe mounts are over-engineered to be a major improvement over the stock subframe mounts not only for performance but also in strength as well. The aluminum is CNC machined for a precise fit and minimal weight. One front bushing is slotted to allow for BMW's manufacturing tolerances. Professional and experienced installation is required.     1999-2005    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi M3  2001-2006    330i 330ci  2003-2008    Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si Z4 M Roadster M Coupe"

It's the worn rubber bushings that contribute to failed rear subframes on the E46 (but not the only reason). As the rubber gets worn, there is more flex to the mount. This flexing is then transferred to the sheetmetal in the floor where the spot welds will pop and the sheetmetal will crack. Additional force coming from stiffer suspensions and stickier tires will only increase the flexing of the mounts/chassis.   Of course, stiffer mounts would help prevent this problem but with a stiffer bushing comes ride harshness, vibration, and additional noise. Our engineers and technicians recommend replacement with the factory rubber bushings (along with the appropriate reinforcement of the floor). The rubber bushings help isolate bumps and impacts and are quiet. They are also a perfect fitment and require no maintenance.   This item is a set of 4 Original BMW rubber subframe mounts.

Nearly all of the suspension arms and bushings mount to the chassis through the subframe. So as the suspension deflects forces from the tires, the subframe eventually absorbs them all. Preventing too much deflection and twist in the subframe will keep your handling and alignment consistent. The stock E82 and E90/E92 rear sub-frame mounts are very soft so putting more torque through the car results in a soft or loose (squirrely) feeling in the rear suspension. This set of 4 mounts are from the M3 and are much stiffer.   These M3 rear subframe bushings are a direct replacement upgrade over the stock mounts. The rear subframe has to come down from the car for these mounts to be pressed in. So now is the perfect time to do other work as well.

Not only do all of the suspension arms attach to it, the driveline runs through it via the differential and half-shafts. Therefore, a track-prepped E46 should never see any flex or deflection in any of the subframe mounts. Excessive movement here transfers to unwanted suspension motions elsewhere and is also a major contributor to failures in the rear floor sheetmetal.   The rubber stock mounts flex and deflect as various forces are applied throughout the subframe - on and off throttle loading, cornering on flat surfaces, bumpy surfaces, weight transfer, sticky race tires, etc. Too much flex from worn rubber mounts will transfer to flex where the subframe meets the chassis/floor. This is the primary cause for the infamous rear subframe failure. Solid mounts like these have almost zero flex to them so they will not contribute to rear subframe issues. The Turner E46 Reinforcement Kit is still recommended.   These solid subframe mounts were designed for racing use only, where we won several sports car championships in the Grand-Am Cup series. These subframe mounts are over-engineered to be a major improvement over the stock subframe mounts not only for performance but also in strength as well. We use a Delrin casing as the primary bushing in the subframe. CNC machined aluminum sleeves are then pressed into the bushings. The sleeves have larger surface area with integrated washers to provide a more secure fit for holding the subframe in position. One front bushing is slotted to allow for BMW's manufacturing tolerances. Professional and experienced installation is required.        1999-2005    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi M3"

Replacing the stock rubber subframe bushings with solid aluminum will limit drivetrain and suspension movement and keep your car’s suspension geometry the way it’s supposed to be. The Delrin diff mount bushing is a near-solid mount that will last longer than the original rubber and does not 'wind up' under load/unload. This transfers more power through the axles to the wheels. The Turner Motorsport E36 318ti and Z3 solid subframe and differential mount bushing kit is a direct replacement for the stock BMW subframe mounts and differential bushing.

This kit is a legal upgrade in many racing classes.   Note: solid subframe mounts are only sold with the solid diff mount.

When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point. At this point, the differential is free to shift under load causing a noticeable clunking noise under acceleration and deceleration and massively increasing the stress on the driveshaft and axles. Manual transmissions suffer the worst from this as it can make shifting difficult since the differential will shift when the clutch is engaged and disengaged."

These are derived from, and currently used in our own Turner E92 M3 racecars. Thick Delrin casings are used as the non-metallic solid bushing. High quality aluminum sleeves, with increased surface area, are then pressed into each of the casings with washers integrated into each one. The washers are employed to add an extra safety factor for securing the sub-frame into position.   The E9x M3 rear sub-frame is the heart of its suspension, and we have found with a short amount of track time the stock bushings will start to degrade. When the M3 sub-frame moves, so do all the suspension mounting points. Replacing the stock rubber bushings limits drivetrain and suspension movement, and keeps your M3's setup the way it's supposed to be. These bushings are CNC machined in the USA and made with high-grade materials.   Feedback from a fellow tuning shop:  ""I never liked the vague feeling and lack of feedback through the rear suspension wit the stock rubber bushings. Also, with the added power of my ESS VT2-650 kit the car required slight steering corrections under WOT in a straight line due to bushing deflection and this really bothered me. It is important to note that I am ultra sensitive when it comes to NVH and other subtle noises and sensations in a car so when I say that the Delrin mounts add close to zero NVH you can trust me! If someone snuck into my garage and installed the mounts at 2am I doubt I would have ever noticed, apart from the super solid and precise feel they give at the rear of the car.""       2010-2012    1M  2008-2012    M3 - Sedan  2008-2012    M3 - Coupe  2008-2012    M3 - Convertible"

The subframe is the heart of a BMW's rear suspension. As torque is transmitted through the differential and axles and as the tires grip the road, the subframe mounts are working to keeping everything in line. That's a tough task to hold when torque is increased with bigger boost (335i) or even mild tweaks (M3). While the M3 subframe mounts are a great upgrade for the non-M chassis these factory BMW Motorsport subframe mounts go one step further.   These Motorsport/Group N rear subframe bushings are a direct replacement upgrade over the stock mounts. They are rubber to conform to the rules of the Group N racing class - so they are still acceptable for street use as long as extra ride harshness can be tolerated. The rear subframe has to come down from the car for these mounts to be pressed in.

The stock rubber bushings have serious drawbacks when used hard on the racetrack - they wear out quickly, and the flexible material allows extreme changes in alignment. Switching to solid bushings will eliminate the deflection and flex, keeping the suspension motions in their intended alignment and providing more feedback to the driver. On the E46 M3, solid bushings can help prevent rear subframe failure as the sheetmetal chassis will no longer flex along with the rubber mount. Depending on the bushing's intended purpose, the material we use is either aluminum or Delrin. Delrin is a dense plastic material that has almost zero deflection and long life. It's self-lubricating so it won't ever need grease or lube. All of our bushings are designed by our in-house R&D engineers and tested on our various racing cars, with many used in professional racing series around the world.   If you're building a car for a racing class, the parts and materials you can change to are specified in the rules. Consult your rulebook or tech steward for any clarification. As these bushings have no play or deflection in them, they are not intended for street-focused cars - they do not absorb impacts and vibration like rubber will.     subframe mounts x 4 (aluminum)  inner-upper control arm bushings x 2 (aluminum with bearing)  differential mounts x 3 (1 Delrin, 2 aluminum)  outer upper/lower control arm bushings x 4 (OE-spec replacements) (steel with bearing)  trailing arm bushings (RTABs) x 2 (aluminum with bearing or Delrin)  suggested: front control arm bushings (FCABs) (Delrin)  suggested: rear shock mounts (RSMs) x 2 (aluminum with bearing)     Note 1: there is also a inner-lower camber arm bushing. We never developed a solid bushing for this point because every racing class allows adjustable camber arms to be used in this location and we offer those with solid inner bushings.  Note 2: some racing classes require a non-bearing bushing for the rear trailing arm bushings. In cases like this, we use a Delrin bushing.  Note 3: the outer upper and lower bushings are already a monoball-style bearing from the factory on all M3 models. They are a great design and last a long time. We offer them here as direct replacements.     2001-2006    M3 M3 CSL"

By replacing the bushings with full polyurethane this play is eliminated since the subframe is being held in place by a much stiffer material that will not harden or shrink over time. Additionally, the inherent stiffness of the urethane material translates body forces much more directly.

They will last longer than the original rubber and do not 'wind up' under load/unload, transferring more power through the axles to the wheels. Recommended for street or race use.

When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point. At this point, the differential is free to shift under load causing a noticeable clunking noise under acceleration and deceleration and massively increasing the stress on the driveshaft and axles. Manual transmissions suffer the worst from this as it can make shifting difficult since the differential will shift when the clutch is engaged and disengaged."

Replacing the stock rubber subframe bushings with solid aluminum will limit drivetrain and suspension movement and keep your car’s suspension geometry the way it’s supposed to be. The Delrin diff mount bushing is a near-solid mount that will last longer than the original rubber and does not 'wind up' under load/unload. This transfers more power through the axles to the wheels. The Turner Motorsport E30 solid subframe and differential mount bushing kit is a direct replacement for the stock BMW subframe mounts and differential bushing. We have incorporated ideas from our other race style solid bushings not only make these very light weight but also to be fully serviceable and removable in the case of subframe or diff cover replacement. This kit is a legal upgrade in many racing classes.    We also sell the Solid Differential mount and Subframe Mounts separately, for those that may already have one of the products or if you desire spares for fast installation.

The rear suspension feels loose and lacks precision. As rubber or hydroelastic bushings wear, the bushing deflection gets worse. If you have a track driven BMW, you're putting even more strain on weak bushings. The solution is a stiffer and more durable material. Even BMW has moved to solid mounts on the modern F10 M5 and F8X M3/M4. These fully solid 318ti/Z3 aluminum mounts have zero deflection - the subframe does not move at all. The rest of the suspension can work as designed and maintain the proper alignment and motion ratios. The driver will notice the difference as the car is more stable and the handling is more precise. Although we designed these for use in our racecars, they can work on the street so long as the driver can tolerate some additional noise, vibration, and harshness.
