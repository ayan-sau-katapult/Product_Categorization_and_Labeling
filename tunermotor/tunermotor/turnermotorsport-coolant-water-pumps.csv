The electric water pumps on older N54 and N55 engines tended to be failure prone.   The N55 water pump is electrically driven and varies output based on instructions from the engine computer. Under the best circumstances the pump drives only as much coolant as needed and will shut down or activate as load and performance demands change (combustion chamber temperatures are dynamically changed based on economy, normal, and performance demands). The pump can also run when the car is off to reduce heat soak in the engine and turbo(s). The water pump is now a factor in how much power and fuel economy your car is producing, making it all the more critical to replace during normal maintenance. If a fault or excessive temperature is reached, the dash cluster will display a yellow or red water temp icon depending on the severity of the condition. The car's electronics will begin shutting down various systems in the car to divert more resources to the cooling system. This can include reducing power output and activating 'limp mode'.   The best way to avoid problems and system failures? Preventative maintenance and overhaul of the cooling system, starting with the water pump (and thermostat).

BMW's engine efficiency design for these cars includes the water pump for balancing engine power output and efficiency and cooling responsibilities not only for the engine but also for the turbo(s) and transmission cooling. It's a very integral part of the engine. The N54/N55 engined cars already suffer from reduced cooling area because of the factory intercooler, tight space under the hood, and of course heat from the turbo(s). BMW addressed these challenges a number of ways, including a dynamic, 'smart' electric water pump with increased output compared to the N52. The cooling demands mean additional stress on the major cooling components, especially the water pump.   The N54/N55 water pump is electrically driven and varies output based on instructions from the engine computer. Under the best circumstances the pump drives only as much coolant as needed and will shut down or activate as load and performance demands change (combustion chamber temperatures are dynamically changed based on economy, normal, and performance demands). The pump can also run when the car is off to reduce heat soak in the engine and turbo(s). The water pump is now a factor in how much power and fuel economy your car is producing, making it all the more critical to replace during normal maintenance. If a fault or excessive temperature is reached, the dash cluster will display a yellow or red water temp icon depending on the severity of the condition. The car's electronics will begin shutting down various systems in the car to divert more resources to the cooling system. This can include reducing power output and activating 'limp mode'.   The best way to avoid problems and system failures? Preventative maintenance and overhaul of the cooling system, starting with the water pump (and thermostat).   This OEM VDO water pump is the latest design and replaces part number 11 51 7 563 659 (11517563659). It fits all cars with the N54 or N55 engine. Replacement of the aluminum mounting screws is required when changing the water pump (select from the options below). Proper bleeding procedures specific to the electric water pump should also be followed.     2008+    135i 1M Coupe  2007+    335i 335xi 335i xDrive - Sedan  2007+    335i 335is 335xi 335i xDrive - Coupe  2007+    335i - Convertible  2007-2010    535i 535xi 535i xDrive  2010+    535i GT, 535i xDrive GT  2011+    535i 535i xDrive   2011+    640i Coupe, 640i Convertible   2009+   740i 740li  2011+    X3 35iX  2010+    X5 35iX  2007-2014    X6 xDrive35i  2009+    Z4 sDrive35i Z4 sDrive35is"

Under the best circumstances the pump drives only as much coolant as needed and will shut down or activate as load and performance demands change (combustion chamber temperatures are dynamically changed based on economy, normal, and performance demands). The pump can also run when the car is off to reduce heat soak in the engine and turbo(s). The water pump is now a factor in how much power and fuel economy your car is producing, making it all the more critical to replace during normal maintenance. If a fault or excessive temperature is reached, the dash cluster will display a yellow or red water temp icon depending on the severity of the condition. The car's electronics will begin shutting down various systems in the car to divert more resources to the cooling system. This can include reducing power output and activating 'limp mode'.    The best way to avoid problems and system failures? Preventative maintenance and overhaul of the cooling system, starting with the water pump (and thermostat).         2012+   335i 335i xDrive - Sedan  2013+   435i 435i xDrive - Coupe  2013+   435i Convertible 435i xDrive Convertible- Convertible  2014+   335i xDrive GT - Gran Tourismo  2014+   435i Gran Coupe 435i xDrive Gran Coupe"

It's a very integral part of the engine.

The original water pump uses a composite impeller, not plastic or metal, so the BMW pump will typically last 85,000+ miles before the bearings show signs of wear (the composite impeller is    the reason for preventative maintenance - it's the bearings). We prefer the OE BMW pump to the aftermarket brands because it uses the composite impeller, it has a proven reliability record, and the pricing represents a solid value upgrade. The pump is located on the front of the engine with the fan attached to it. The complexity of the S54 engine means the water pump has multiple gaskets and seals that should also be replaced. And if the thermostat has not been changed then this is the best time for a new one as well.     The S54 water pump has multiple gaskets and O-rings that should be replaced at the same time. The water pump does not come from BMW with a profile gasket anyway and all of the hoses and thermostat housing have their own seals. We don't recommend re-using the original gaskets so we have an add-on kit that will have you covered during your water pump replacement -  1 x 11531318402, thermostat housing gasket to water pump housing  1 x 11537830709, coolant return pipe on thermostat housing  1 x 11517831099, water pump profile gasket  2 x 11537830712, coolant hose rubber O-rings     BMW designed this water pump to use a composite impeller. It is much stronger than the plastic pieces that were so problematic in the mid-90s. The aftermarket solution to the plastic issues was to use a metal impeller. This solved the impeller issues but created some others. The metal impeller is heavier than composite or plastic and that led to quicker bearing failure on the E36 pump (sometimes within a year). The possibility exists that the same premature bearing failure can happen on the E46 M3 metal impeller pumps as well. The heavier weight also has the drawback of using more horsepower since it requires more effort to move the heavier piece. The composite materials solve all of these issues - light weight, strong, long lasting, and relatively inexpensive. They also come with a two-year warranty (most aftermarket pumps are one year). Original BMW water pumps for the E36 (and most other modern BMWs) now use a composite impeller so any issues with factory pumps are long gone. Original BMW water pumps for the E46 M3 are known to last over 100,000 miles and the composite is still in excellent condition (failure is usually typical leaks from worn bearings). For preventative maintenance we recommend a replacement around 85,000 miles. Alternate part numbers: 11517838118, 11517838159.     2001-2006    M3"

The electric water pumps on older N54 and N55 engines tended to be failure prone.   The N55 water pump is electrically driven and varies output based on instructions from the engine computer. Under the best circumstances the pump drives only as much coolant as needed and will shut down or activate as load and performance demands change (combustion chamber temperatures are dynamically changed based on economy, normal, and performance demands). The pump can also run when the car is off to reduce heat soak in the engine and turbo(s). The water pump is now a factor in how much power and fuel economy your car is producing, making it all the more critical to replace during normal maintenance. If a fault or excessive temperature is reached, the dash cluster will display a yellow or red water temp icon depending on the severity of the condition. The car's electronics will begin shutting down various systems in the car to divert more resources to the cooling system. This can include reducing power output and activating 'limp mode'.    The best way to avoid problems and system failures?
