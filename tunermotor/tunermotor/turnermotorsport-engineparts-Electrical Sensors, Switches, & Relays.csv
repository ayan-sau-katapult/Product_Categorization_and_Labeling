BMW integrated the intake air temp sensor in the MAF housing on models such as the E39 M5, and, being sandwiched behind a hot radiator and in some applications next to an even hotter valve cover, this is less than ideal for performance applications. Absorbing excess heat from its surroundings, the MAF can’t shed it fast enough, and the ECU reads an inaccurately high intake air temperature. Compensating for this false hot air measurement, the ECU pulls timing and runs a richer fuel mixture, resulting in a significant loss of torque."

There are usually 2-3 reference sensors mounted on the transmission bellhousing and this one part number is used for both sensors. BMW changed to one sensor part number that covers both of the old numbers (the only difference was the length of the cables). Even though the sensors are the same the ECU is interpreting their data differently. One is used for reading RPM and the other is for crankshaft position or cylinder identification (depending on the model). If the ECU cannot detect crankshaft position or rotation it will not trigger the ignition and start the car. Or if the signal is poor the engine could have misfires and poor running. So this is a vital sensor that you should not neglect! You might even want to keep a spare in your car or toolbox.On the E30 M3 (and possibly others) the old sensors were referenced by markings on the sensor plug. Since the new BMW part number covers both sensors it might be a good idea to mark both ends yourself to help in identification later."

Most of the factory and aftermarket sensors are located after the oil pump, which does not give you an accurate temp reading of the oil that is actually lubricating the engine. At the factory temp sensor location the sensor picks up heat not only from the oil stream, but also from the oil pump and housing which will skew the reading. Other aftermarket adapters can be give inaccurate readings from their location and/or design limitations. And may require making unnecessary modifications. By relocating the sensor to the oil sump it reduces clutter and sits flush against the bottom of the oil pan to avoid potential clearance issues. Testing that we have done on and off the track shows that the sump location is the most accurate. We accomplish this by removing the factory oil level sensor or block off plate and using the existing hole and bolt pattern on the oil pan with no additional modifications. Any sensor with an M12 x 1.50mm thread can be used in the flange. Note that removing the factory oil level sensor will trigger the low oil fault/warning light. There's no elegant way around this but since the Temp Flange is considered a race-only part we assume you will be checking your own oil level anyway or be using a stand-alone dash/engine management system that does not track oil level. And having the most accurate oil temp is more important."

There are usually 2-3 reference sensors mounted on the transmission bellhousing and this one part number is used for both sensors. BMW changed to one sensor part number that covers both of the old numbers (the only difference was the length of the cables). Even though the sensors are the same the ECU is interpreting their data differently. One is used for reading RPM and the other is for crankshaft position or cylinder identification (depending on the model). If the ECU cannot detect crankshaft position or rotation it will not trigger the ignition and start the car. Or if the signal is poor the engine could have misfires, poor running, or hard starting. So this is a vital sensor that you should not neglect! You might even want to keep a spare in your car or toolbox. Priced per sensor.On the E30 M3 (and possibly others) the old sensors were referenced by markings on the sensor plug. Since the new BMW part number covers both sensors it might be a good idea to mark both ends yourself to help in identification later.BMW part numbers 12141708619 and 1214708618 are now interchangable with 12141730773."

What you would notice is sluggish driving, hesitation, poor performance, jerky shifts from an automatic, and other drivability issues. These types of issues are typically diagnosed as ignition coils (which are their own issue altogether) but this sensor may also be faulty.The eccentric shaft sensor is located at the front of the cylinder head and is only accessible with the valve cover off. It's easy to check for oil by removing the engine trim cover (the outer cover with the BMW roundel), unplug the sensor, and look inside. If oil is present inside, or even on the valve cover itself, the sensor is likely contaminated or ready to fail. You can wipe or clean the oil from sitting inside the sensor but it will come back.If you're planning this job make sure you have our Valve Cover Overhaul Kit, which includes a new seal for the eccentric sensor as well as the rest of the valve cover and Valvetronic gaskets.

The E24 can have a crank position sensor (CPS) in one of two places: mounted in the transmission bellhousing reading the flywheel (early cars) or on the front of the engine block reading the teeth on the front crank pulley (later cars). The BMW parts information does not show a clear cutoff for each so check your car before ordering. The CPS sends a position signal to the DME so the computer knows when the engine is at TDC and can start the car. It's also when the engine is running for ignition timing. If your engine is not starting or running with misfires this is definitely one of the likely causes. Keep one as a spare to avoid downtime or being stranded!   This also sends a TDC signal in the E30 M3 but it's only used during diagnostic tests. The sensor is located on the upper transmission bellhousing, separate from the other reference sensors. It's only sending a signal to the diagnostic connector, not to the ECU itself. One of the problems with these reference sensors is that they all look alike, especially the male pin connectors on the body of the car. The TDC reference sensor itself is shorter and stubbier than the other two sensors on the M3 bellhousing. Unlike the other two sensors it does not have any markings or special features, just a plain black connector. And it's often missing from the car because it is not required to run and previous owners may have removed it to eliminate confusion.   When doing any sort of repair or maintenance there is no replacement for genuine factory parts. Turner Motorsport carries the Genuine BMW brand with pride and has the parts you need to complete your next project with confidence.     1988-1991    M3  6/1987-1989    635csi"

The 140 amp is an upgrade, deliverying more power to your electrical system, ideal for cars with more electrical items (such as high powered stereo systems, convertible tops, etc). Bosch is an original equipment supplier to BMW, and is the finest and most recognized German brand of alternator available. Buy only the best alternator for your BMW -- buy a Bosch alternator.   Note: this alternator does not come with a pulley. Bosch does not supply any pulley with this during their rebuilds.  If you are replacing an existing 140a alternator, simply re-use your original pulley.  If you are replacing a Bosch alternator of a different amp, measure your existing pulley and confirm it is 55mm in diameter.  If you are replacing a Valeo brand alternator, you will need to also purchase the 55mm alternator pulley from the menu below. Your original Valeo pulley will not work on the new Bosch alternator.   Bosch is one of the largest OEM producers of Genuine BMW and aftermarket parts in the world, providing parts for almost every major automotive manufacturer.

This sensor is crucial for starting the car as the ECU will not allow the engine to start without this signal. It fits all M20 engines in the E30 and E34. A lot of times the sensor is covered in oil, broken from a spinning belt, or the clearance to the pulley is not correct (should be .040""). Interchangeable with #12141720856.     Original BMW - more expensive but higher quality and more consistent reliability. The sensor itself has a metal housing that is more durable and will not be affected by heat as much.  Aftermarket/Overseas manufacturer - cheaper than OE BMW but less quality and potentially less consistent. Plastic housing is more susceptible to damage from heat.     1987-1991    325e 325es 325i 325is 325ix 325ic  1989-1990    525i"

It's a normal wear item and the contacts are the first thing to check if you believe the alternator is not charging the battery (lights flickering or dim, battery light on in the dash, the engine quits without warning, or other electrical failures). The voltage regulator manages the voltage flowing through the car, especially to and from the battery. There are two carbon contacts on the regulator that control the magnetic field when the alternator is spinning and these contacts wear over time. There is a wear mark on the contacts and if the tip is within 3mm of this wear mark the regulator should be replaced, regardless if that is the cause of your electrical problems or not. Most older mechanics will tell you to keep a spare regulator in your toolbox.   Bosch is one of the largest OEM producers of Genuine BMW and aftermarket parts in the world, providing parts for almost every major automotive manufacturer. Bosch has likely supplied many of the original electrical (and mechanical) parts for your BMW. Thanks to their exacting assembly process and high level of durability you can expect a long service life from all Bosch products.   This is the OEM Bosch voltage regulator and will only fit Bosch alternators."
