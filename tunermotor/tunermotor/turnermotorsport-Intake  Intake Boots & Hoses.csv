It's no wonder you don't see this type of restrictive setup on the E46 M3 CSL!    The Samco silicone intake boot for E46 M3 has a perfectly smooth interior surface, engineered for the best flow and smoothest transision -- no sharp edges or angles to hang up or slow down the air. Made in the UK using a 4 layer silicone design. Unlike the stock E46 M3 rubber boot, which is prone to drying, cracking and leaking, the Samco boot is virtually indestructable and ready for the rigors of heat temperature and extreme conditions.      2001-2006    coupe & convertible"

Relocating the inlets on your N54 with the ARM Inlets increase the power and torque of your N54 up to 60whp/60wtq. Expect improved turbo spool, faster peak boost, and more volume from the turbochargers on your N54. If you're looking to max out your stock or upgraded twin turbochargers these are a must! Highlights: Gains of up to 60whp/60wtq Quicker Turbo Spool Increased Turbo Volume One of the greatest challenges when upgrading to relocated inlets on your N54 is mitigating the heat of the air induced by the turbos. With the inlets relocated to the passenger-side the filters are closer to the turbochargers where temperatures are hotter. The ARM N54 Inlets come with a manifold heat shield which serves to help keep heat down near the turbos and away from the inlet filters. This also assists with keeping heat away from the inlet tubes themselves. In addition, the ARM Inlets come with an air filter heat shield which assists in keeping the cooler air near the filters separate from hotter air coming from the engine adjacent to it. The air filters on the ARM Inlets are secured in place with a filter bracket which prevents filters and inlets themselves from bouncing around during acceleration, braking, and cornering. Also included with the ARM Inlets is a support bracket for the boost solenoids. This keeps them locked into place during extreme driving. To help make installation easy, relocation brackets for the coolant reservoir and power steering pump reservoir are included with the ARM Inlets. Kit Includes: ARM Relocated Inlets Manifold Heat Shield Air Filter Head Shield Coolant Reservoir Relocation Brackets Power Steering Reservoir Relocation Bracket Boost Solenoid Bracket Clamps"

Relocating the inlets on your N54 with the ARM Inlets increase the power and torque of your N54 up to 60whp/60wtq. Expect improved turbo spool, faster peak boost, and more volume from the turbochargers on your N54. If you're looking to max out your stock or upgraded twin turbochargers these are a must! Highlights: Gains of up to 60whp/60wtq Quicker Turbo Spool Increased Turbo Volume One of the greatest challenges when upgrading to relocated inlets on your N54 is mitigating the heat of the air induced by the turbos. With the inlets relocated to the passenger-side the filters are closer to the turbochargers where temperatures are hotter. The ARM N54 Inlets come with a manifold heat shield which serves to help keep heat down near the turbos and away from the inlet filters. This also assists with keeping heat away from the inlet tubes themselves. In addition, the ARM Inlets come with an air filter heat shield which assists in keeping the cooler air near the filters separate from hotter air coming from the engine adjacent to it. The air filters on the ARM Inlets are secured in place with a filter bracket which prevents filters and inlets themselves from bouncing around during acceleration, braking, and cornering. Also included with the ARM Inlets is a support bracket for the boost solenoids. This keeps them locked into place during extreme driving. To help make installation easy, relocation brackets for the coolant reservoir and power steering pump reservoir are included with the ARM Inlets. Kit Includes: ARM Relocated Inlets Manifold Heat Shield Air Filter Head Shield Coolant Reservoir Relocation Brackets Power Steering Reservoir Relocation Bracket Boost Solenoid Bracket Clamps"
