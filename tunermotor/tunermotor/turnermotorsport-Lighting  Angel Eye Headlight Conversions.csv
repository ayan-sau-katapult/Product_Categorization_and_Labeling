By comparison, the stock 35-watt halogen bulb receives only 80-90% power, and then drops to 50% power to reduce heat within the headlight housing when utilized with the headlights; thus causing stock the angel eyes to become even dimmer. The LUX H8 189 angel eyes have been designed to compensate for this dimming and always operate at full power, allowing them to be highly visible in virtually all the daytime conditions. When locking the car, the LUX will pulse off rather than fade. In addition, LUX LED bulbs use a fraction of the power of stocks, allowing them to run cooler and have a longer lifespan.",,,,

They transformed the dim yellow appearance of the factory angel eyes to a bright white light that helps your BMW stand out from the crowd. As part of our preparation before the race we tested tons of different bulbs from dozens of manufacturers. These bulbs offered the highest brightness of any bulb we tested and more importantly the quality of construction was unsurpassed. They lasted the whole 24 hours with no issues! The last thing we wanted was for our M3 to have a black eye or experience the flickering common on lower quality bulbs. If they can withstand the intensity of one of the worlds toughest races then they will certainly perform well on the street.      These upgraded LED angel eye bulbs are actually pretty easy to install. First, you'll want to remove the front wheel and plastic fender liner. This gives you access behind the headlight assemblies, where the stock angel eye bulbs are located (the stock angel eye bulbs have a green and brown wire on the connector.) Remove those dim stock bulbs, and these ultra-bright LED replacements install in their place, using a phillips head screw driver. The stock wiring is connected to the ballast pack of the LED bulbs. Once installed, the before and after is a striking difference. Not only is the light whiter, it's vastly brighter than the original ""yellow"" halogen bulbs, giving your E90 a more modern appearance. Best of all, these bulbs won't cause any check control system warnings. Sold as a pair. One kit will illuminate all 4 angel eye rings on your BMW. Made from high quality machined aluminum.     2009-2011    328i 328xi 328i xDrive 335d 335i 335xi 335i xDrive - Sedan -    2009-2012    328i 328xi 328i xDrive - Wagon -    >",,,,
