The Turner Adjustable Rear Camber Arms: The Only Adjustable Arms Approved for Grand-Am Continental Tire Challenge Racing Series Why you should use Turner Motorsport camber arms on your car: If you have a lowered car and have run out of adjustment with the stock camber arms. If you have a track car and are looking for increased camber adjustment, lightweight pieces, stronger components, and improved suspension handling Two bushing styles to meet your needs: solid rod-end for track-only use (See T#304098), or rubber bushing for mixed street/track use (approved by Grand-Am!) The high range of adjustment allows a full racecar setup or a heavily lowered car to maintain factory specifications. Only high quality and high strength materials and components are used Aluminum camber arms are designed as a lightweight component, thereby reducing wear and tear on other, more critical parts (rear subframe, control arm bushings, etc). Each camber arm weighs only 2.5 lbs making for a total of 5 lbs for both parts! Stock camber arms weigh 3 lbs each. We have seen competitor's arms that weigh twice as much! Hardcoat anodized aluminum, stainless steel turnbuckles, and stainless rod ends to all but eliminate corrosion from getting into the threads and making adjustment difficult.

The KMAC plates are a 'floating' design so camber and caster are adjusted together. This design allows maximum range of adjustment since no other hardware interferes with the adjustments. Since these replace your stock strut bearings they are designed to work with a stock-type spring only. And when installed correctly will not significantly alter ride height. Adjustment is easily done by loosening the three nuts on top of the tower and sliding the camber plate into the position you want, then re-tighten the nuts.

Camber increases to between -2.5° to -3.0°, depending on each individual car. While ride height is increased by 1/4"", the benefit of these plates far outweighs the minor ride height increase. The rate of camber change is virtually unaffected throughout the range of suspension travel, reducing the need for other geometry correction.

Since there is less bushing than on the Stage 1, more noise and vibration will reach the driver. The adjustment design is similar to the Stage 1 with a floating mount that sets camber and caster simultaneously. This design allows maximum range of adjustment since no other hardware interferes with the adjustments. These plates can work on both coil over and stock-stype suspensions and upper spring perches are included for OEM springs, 60mm, and 2.5"" coil over springs. The upper perch assembly incorporate a self-sliding radial bushing that allows the spring to spin during its travel instead of bind. This reduces tension on the spring and helps reduce noise and spring 'popping' noises. Bearing inserts, spacers for correct articulating angles, and 3 sizes of upper nut adapters included. The urethane bushings and bearings are replaceable if they wear out. These are designed mainly for adding negative camber for improved handling and not for camber correction back to stock settings (see Stage 1 kit).

Our line of BMW performance parts combines high quality, great value, and most importantly, superior performance and adjustability that will allow you to dial in your ride to suit your driving style and allow your BMW to live up to its full potential. These adjustable caster/camber plates are the perfect complement to stock springs or lowering springs, and allow you to compensate for a lower stance or choose a more aggressive alignment for superior handling. Design Highlights include: preserves the correct E9X RWD geometry separate sliding camber and caster adjustments maximum shock travel lightweight durable materials large surface area ease of use The Turner E9X Non-M RWD Race Camber Plates are the most advanced design on the market. These are designed specifically for E90/92 Non-M RWD - no shortcuts or cookie-cutter components. Starting with a fresh design to make these very user friendly and easy to install and set up. The front suspension has unique geometry and the strut is mounted at an angle that can put significant side loading on the strut shaft if it's not located properly. The location and angles for the main bearing were carefully engineered to allow the proper motion ratio and strut angles during adjustment. This greatly reduces bending forces on the strut itself which improves performance and longevity. By designing for only one chassis, they were able to focus on what works best in that application - proper fitment and operation without unnecessary adapters, easy-to-use camber and caster adjustments, and an intelligent modular design. Another important feature of these Camber Plates is the size of the upper plate. The plates have a very large surface area to better spread strut forces through the strut tower. A smaller upper plate, like those found on competitor's kits, will localize strut forces and contribute to strut tower deformation ('strut tower mushrooming'). This is a very important feature especially as these cars get older and spend more time on the track. Deformed strut towers are a serious performance and safety concern and our camber plates are properly designed to handle the loads. The factory strut reinforcement plates are not required with these camber plates (but you can use them if you want to). Included is a hardware kit for use both 12mm and 14mm threaded strut shafts, as well as a square or tapered seats; no additional sleeves or bearing adapters required. ​Features Include: Camber Adjustment Range: 2+ degrees without removing strut from the vehicle - Verified on alignment rack Caster adjustment range: 2.5+ degrees without removing strut from the vehicle - Verified on alignment rack Reduces ride height by less than 14mm compared to OEM Shock Pin position remains approximately the same compared to OEM Compatible with OEM style springs and spring perches Retains OE bump stop location and compatibility FK FKSSX12T Maintenance-free, PTFE lined, stainless steel spherical bearing/monoball for low friction shaft articulation Bearing utilizes lower and upper seals to prevent moisture and debris contamination for greatly improved bearing life Included are two sleeve nut pairs. One pair of M12x1.5mm sleeve nuts and one pair of M14x1.5mm sleeve nuts. Wide plate assembly offers excellent load distribution to address concerns with strut tower deformation",

This will put more of the tire's width in contact with the ground during cornering. With more rubber, there is more grip. BMWs typically have less camber in the front to create understeer. But if you're running a stock setup on the track or autocross you are giving up speed and time as the front tires run out of grip sooner than they should. Designed in-house for the highest quality and versatility possible, we are confident our Hybrid Camber Plates are the perfect solution for your BMW M3! The first requirement we had envisioned for our plates is wide adjustability while the struts are still installed. This is to ensure that your suspension can be dialed in for either street or track without any issues. Our plates offer 3+ degrees of camber adjustment and 2.5+ degrees of caster adjustment. The next key feature of our camber plates is long term reliability. To achieve this, maintenance free, PTFE lined, stainless steel spherical monoballs were utilized along with replaceable 80A polyurethane bushings, giving these plates a long bearing life and reduced NVH. To further increase longevity, the bearing design features upper and lower seals to keep out moisture and contaminants. The final and most important design requirement was how these plates worked specifically with the E9X M3. To guarantee these plates were the best choice for your BMW, we designed these camber plates with as large of a surface area as possible to ensure even distribution of forces throughout the strut tower, preventing common mushrooming or cracking of the thin OE steel mounting location. We managed to accomplish this by staying close to the original suspension geometry, adding 13.5mm of height to the stock shock pin position and only 3.5mm overall to ride height. This ended up further benefitting vehicles with lowered suspension by improving shock travel distance and reducing the risk of bottoming out. These camber plates are fully compatible with OEM bump stops, factory style springs. and include hardware that accommodates both square seat and tapered seat shock pins. Features and Specifications: Camber adjustment range: 3+ degrees Caster adjustment range: 2.5+ degrees Wide plate offering superior load distribution Bolt rings: powder coated steel with 10.9 zinc plated knurled studs Housing constructed from 6061-T6 alloy with type 2 black anodizing 13.5mm higher shock pin position for longer travel OEM bump stop compatible Utilizes OEM spring perch pillow ball bearing 31331090612 Compatible with square and taper seat shock pins Race & stock spring compatible FK FKSSX12T Maintenance free, PTFE lined, stainless steel spherical bearing Bearing isolated by replaceable 80A polyurethane bushings Upper and lower sealed bearings",

Our line of BMW performance parts combines high quality, great value, and most importantly, superior performance and adjustability that will allow you to dial in your ride to suit your driving style and allow your BMW to live up to its full potential. These adjustable caster/camber plates are the perfect complement to stock springs or lowering springs, and allow you to compensate for a lower stance or choose a more aggressive alignment for superior handling. Design Highlights include: preserves the correct E36 geometry separate sliding camber and caster adjustments maximum shock travel lightweight durable materials large surface area ease of use The Turner E36 Non-M Race Camber Plates are the most advanced design on the market. These are designed specifically for E36 Non-M - no shortcuts or cookie-cutter components. Starting with a fresh design to make these very user friendly and easy to install and set up. The front suspension has unique geometry and the strut is mounted at an angle that can put significant side loading on the strut shaft if it's not located properly. The location and angles for the main bearing were carefully engineered to allow the proper motion ratio and strut angles during adjustment. This greatly reduces bending forces on the strut itself which improves performance and longevity. By designing for only one chassis, they were able to focus on what works best in that application - proper fitment and operation without unnecessary adapters, easy-to-use camber and caster adjustments, and an intelligent modular design. Another important feature of these Camber Plates is the size of the upper plate. The plates have a very large surface area to better spread strut forces through the strut tower. A smaller upper plate, like those found on competitor's kits, will localize strut forces and contribute to strut tower deformation ('strut tower mushrooming'). This is a very important feature especially as these cars get older and spend more time on the track. Deformed strut towers are a serious performance and safety concern and our camber plates are properly designed to handle the loads. The factory strut reinforcement plates are not required with these camber plates (but you can use them if you want to). Included is a hardware kit for use both 12mm and 14mm threaded strut shafts, as well as a square or tapered seats; no additional sleeves or bearing adapters required. ​Features Include: Camber Adjustment Range: 2+ degrees without removing strut from the vehicle - Verified on alignment rack Caster adjustment range: 2.5+ degrees without removing strut from the vehicle - Verified on alignment rack Reduces ride height by less than 14mm compared to OEM Shock Pin position remains approximately the same compared to OEM Compatible with OEM style springs and spring perches Retains OE bump stop location and compatibility FK FKSSX12T Maintenance-free, PTFE lined, stainless steel spherical bearing/monoball for low friction shaft articulation Bearing utilizes lower and upper seals to prevent moisture and debris contamination for greatly improved bearing life Included are two sleeve nut pairs.

The urethane main bushing is also replaceable and the camber plate parts are made from 7075-grade aluminum for a lifetime of camber plate use.   Fitment Note 1: replaces factory BMW strut mount with 3 mounting bolts (up to 12/2014 prodution). Not for cars with 5-bolt strut mounts.   Fitment Note 2: suspensions vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. The proper stacked height and clearances are required. K-MAC includes bearing adapters, spacers, and various top nuts but it is still the responsibility of the installer to ensure a correct and safe fitment. Basic instructions are included but professional installation is required. As with any race-derived component, additonal fabrication may be required.     -12/2014   228i 228i xDrive M235i M235i xDrive  2012-12/2014   320i 320i xDrive 328d 328d xDrive 328i 328i xDrive 335i 335i xDrive - Sedan  2013-12/2014   328i xDrive 328d xDrive - Wagon  -12/2014   328i xDrive GT, 335i xDrive GT - Gran Tourismo  2013-12/2014   428i 428i xDrive 435i 435i xDrive - Coupe  2013-12/2014   428i Convertible 428i xDrive Convertible 435i Convertible - Convertible  -12/2014   428i Gran Coupe 428i xDrive Gran Coupe 435i Gran Coupe 435i xDrive Gran Coupe",

The KMAC plates are a 'floating' design so camber and caster are adjusted together. This design allows maximum range of adjustment since no other hardware interferes with the adjustments. Since these replace your stock strut bearings they are designed to work with a stock-type spring only. And when installed correctly will not significantly alter ride height. Adjustment is easily done by loosening the three nuts on top of the tower and sliding the camber plate into the position you want, then re-tighten the nuts. These mounts can be installed two ways - for camber correction or swapped side-side for increasing negative camber. Detailed instructions included.
