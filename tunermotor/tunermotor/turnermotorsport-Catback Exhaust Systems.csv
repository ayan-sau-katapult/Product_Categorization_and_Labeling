This makes for an excellent replacement exhaust system because the sound is such a great match to the M30 engine and retro cool that these cars have now.

This Supersprint system is a direct bolt-on replacement to this system. BMW changed the center resonator and cat flanges from a 3-bolt triangle to a 2-bolt diamond-shaped flange. The Supersprint center resonator uses the 3-bolt flange. So you must either cut off the 3-bolt flange and reinstall the original 2-bolt flange. Or cut the 2-bolt flange from the cat and weld on a new 3-bolt flange (BMW p/n 18111178137 and gaskets p/n 18301723886, available separately).This system was originally designed for the Euro E24/E28 which does not have the rear hanger attachment over the tips like on a US model (you will need the Euro hanger setup). In addition the tips are shorter on the Euro muffler since the Euro bumpers do not extend as far as the US bumpers. So the tips on this muffler will sit just past the valance but tucked far under the bumper."

You can pick and choose from either a 60mm Exhaust manifold, designed for increased exhaust flow and higher power potential, or a 63.5mm Racing Exhaust Manifold, built entirely for the best exhaust flow possible! To accompany the headers, you again have the choice of either a catted Section 1 exhaust pipes that feature high-flow metallic catalytic converters, keeping emissions down, or straight Section 1 pipes that eliminate the secondary catalytic converters, eliminating unnecessary exhaust restrictions. Available either as a part of a full system or by itself, the Supersprint Section 2 X-Pipe is the perfect replacement for the factory x-pipe that is resonated and adds another point of excessive restriction and muffling. The Supersprint X-pipe has a straight-through design that provides better flow characteristics and gives your BMW a slightly more aggressive exhaust note. The last set of exhaust components available are the Mufflers and the optional connecting kit. Available in two versions, Sport or Race, Supersprint mufflers are designed with power in mind, while still giving amazing exhaust tones! The Sport mufflers are slightly louder than stock and flow much better than the stock mufflers, and the Race mufflers are even louder and more free-flowing, giving your Z4 M an amazing exhaust sound that never gets old! If you want to run only the mufflers and not any of the other components, you must also purchase the connecting kit which allows you to pair the mufflers with your stock x-pipe. If you decide to go with the Supersprint X-pipe, the connecting kit is not needed.

This flow optimized exhaust system reduces exhaust backpressure and allows the M3�s 414 horsepower S65 V8 engine to produce an even more powerful sound. Inconel�s unique qualities allowed engineers to reduce the thickness of the tubing from 1.5mm to 0.8mm. This resulted in a weight reduction of approximately 40%, or about 20 lbs. when compared to the stock exhaust system. Inconel has also proven to be very corrosion resistant and has been used at the highest level of Motorsports. The M Performance Exhaust includes perforated inner pipes and polished titanium tips, which are laser engraved with the M logo. It represents the ultimate in technology and sportiness, accentuating the individual character of the BMW M3.

The E46 Borla bolts straight to the factory manifold and uses all of the factory hangers for an easy and seamless install. Your factory exhaust can come off as one complete piece and bolt this in its place! This is a full stainless system - T304 inside and out for maximum corrosion resistance. The Borla flows better than the stock system too for increased performance, even over the stock ZHP system. But we love the sound of this system the most - deep and with plenty of rumble to set it apart from the stock sound. It's a tuned system, with front resonator and rear muffler, to be louder than stock but not excessive. It's also a lot lighter than the stock system at only 33lbs from nose to tailpipe.   Read what Borla owners have to say:  ""The difference over stock is noticeable the instant you turn the key. It begins with a deep muted rumble at engine start. Between 1200-2000rpm, you are treated to a nice throaty (and somewhat loud) growl. Between 2500-3500rpm, the deep growl reveals a slightly deeper, more melodic mechanical rev-up. Once past 4500rpm, the car begins to sound surprisingly stock, all the way up to redline. Lifting off the gas reveals a slightly more pronounced ""burble"" that settles into a low rumble as revs drop back to idle. At steady cruising speeds, the exhaust does not drone. Planting your right foot brings back that wonderful low growl.""  ""...the Borla is a very well built unit. Very civilized exhaust note... more agressive, yet not obnoxiously loud.""  ""I can easily say the Borla exhaust is much better than the X&X exhaust. My brother has the Borla on his 330i ZHP, and I had the X&X on my 330i. The X&X exhaust didn't have the quality of engineering compared to the Borla. The X&X was louder, and had horrible resonation - unacceptable for street use. The Borla is bolt-on, excellent quality, and hangs perfectly straight. The sound is a bit louder than stock, yet never ""rice"" or obnoxious.""   Every Borla is made with 304 stainless steel for the internals and muffler body. Unlike other systems that can use coated aluminum, mild steel, or 409 stainless, the Borla uses true 304 stainless on the inside as well as the outside. This prevents the muffler from rusting and deteriorating from the inside out. Borla guarantees every muffler with a 1,000,000 mile warranty. Turner Motorsport has been the leading Borla dealer for BMW exhausts since we sold our first system in 1996, including using Borla Exhausts on all of every Turner BMW racecar.     2001-2005    325i 325ci 330i 330ci"

Corsa has designed a E46 performance exhaust with a tuned aggressive sound that is worlds apart from the stock ho-hum exhaust. But thanks to their innovative RSC technology this exhaust stays civilized at normal speeds and RPM. This is a sport exhaust that you can live with on a daily basis but it opens up when you get on it. This is the complete Corsa cat-back for the E46 and includes front and center resonators, and the rear muffler. It's a full replacement for the complete stock E46 exhaust and bolts to the stock exhaust manifold/catalytic converter. Tips are available as polished or black and laser engraved with the Corsa logo. The black tips have an innovative coating that won't chip or flake and provides outstanding corrosion resistance.   Although known as the Twin Silencer Exhaust (TSE3) this system almost has dual personalities. When driven aggressively it produces a throaty and charismatic exhaust note with just a hint of inline-6 rasp. We think the sound has a terrific blend of American muscle and European refinement. It has plenty of burbles and pops that a performance exhaust should have and compliments other performance upgrades you may have on your car. But when driven lightly there's only a slight hint of sporty sound. It becomes a subdued version of its other self and completely livable on daily and highway trips with NO DRONE! You can use it on a daily driver without it being annoying or intrusive and then let it off its leash for the weekend fun runs.   Reflective Sound-Cancellation (RSC) technology - This feature is a patented non-electrical noise control system, where engine sound (pressure) waves are reflected in passages inside the muffler 180 degrees out of phase to cancel out unwanted sound waves. The result is a tuned muffler that ""cleans up"" the noise without eliminating the pure sound of power associated with a high-performance vehicle. Using the Corsa technology, the stainless steel mufflers are tuned to eliminate passenger cabin resonance and produce just the ""right"" sound. The result is quieter cruising with an awe-inspiring roar at full throttle. This system is amazingly quiet during normal cruising, due to the ""no drone"" RSC technology, yet still has an aggressive presence and full sound while under throttle. This makes for ideal sound for those that want an aggressive ""roar"" while driving hard, yet still want a more discrete lower volume for normal cruising.   This is a complete system from the catalytic converter back. On the E46 325/330 the factory catalytic converter is located in the exhaust manifold. This system will bolt to the manifold and use all of the factory hangers. It's very easy and straightforward to install and the stock exhaust can be removed from the car as one piece, saving time and hassle. No cutting or welding is required for install. Detailed photographic instructions are included. This system is 100% Made in the USA and carries a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. This exhaust is emissions legal in all 50 states (no effect whatsoever on emissions, and no ""Check Engine"" warning lights).               2001-2006    325i 325ci 330i 330ci (not for convertibles)"

Complete Cat-Back Exhaust Made in the USA Lifetime Warranty TURNER Corsa Performance T-304 stainless exhaust system for 2001-2006 E46 M3. Features mandrel-bent tubing, polished quad 3"" tips, and drone-free quiet-cruising, thanks to patented Reflective Sound-Cancellation (RSC) technology. The Corsa system also eliminates the ""rasp"" characteristics of the stock exhaust sound. This rasp-elimination is accomplished just like the old ""Rasp-X"" product. This system is amazingly quiet during normal cruising, due to the ""no drone"" RSC technology, yet still has an aggressive presence and full sound while under throttle. This makes for ideal sound for those that want an aggressive ""roar"" while driving hard, yet still want a more discrete lower volume for normal cruising. (Please check out the video below for a sound sample). Reflective Sound-Cancellation (RSC) technology - This feature is a patented non-electrical noise control system, where engine sound (pressure) waves are reflected in passages inside the muffler 180 degrees out of phase to cancel out unwanted sound waves. The result is a tuned muffler that ""cleans up"" the noise without eliminating the pure sound of power associated with a high-performance vehicle. Using the Corsa technology, the stainless steel mufflers are tuned to eliminate passenger cabin resonance and produce just the ""right"" sound. The result is quieter cruising with an awe-inspiring roar at full throttle. This system is amazingly quiet during normal cruising, due to the ""no drone"" RSC technology, yet still has an aggressive presence and full sound while under throttle. This makes for ideal sound for those that want an aggressive ""roar"" while driving hard, yet still want a more discrete lower volume for normal cruising. This is a complete system from the catalytic converter back. On the E46 M3 the factory catalytic converter is located in the exhaust manifold. This system will bolt to the manifold and use all of the factory hangers. It's very easy and straightforward to install and the stock exhaust can be removed from the car as one piece, saving time and hassle. No cutting or welding is required for install. Detailed photographic instructions are included. This system is 100% Made in the USA and carries a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. This exhaust is emissions legal in all 50 states (no effect whatsoever on emissions, and no ""Check Engine"" warning lights).

Additionally, the two titanium tail pipes are an important part of the Akrapovic exhaust system and a must-show.    This Akrapovic exhaust improves upon the stock exhaust system (with a Slip-On system) of the BMW 335i in numerous areas. The first visible improvement is the additional power of 7,2 HP (at 5.950 rpm) and 8,1 Nm (at 3.560 rpm). The range between 2.500 rpm and 3.000 rpm and at 3.500 rpm was particularly improved. A noticeable improvement can also be observed at high RPM where the Slip-On gives more power. When trying to achieve better performance, weight also plays a big role. The Akrapovic Slip-On exhaust system for the BMW 335i is 7,88* kilograms (17.38lbs) lighter when compared with a stock exhaust, which gives it an even better power to weight ratio.

The middle S-Spec exhaust not too loud, not too quiet. It's just right. Borla builds their exhaust with the goal of enhancing the sound - not just making it outrageously loud. In fact, Borla exhausts deliver some of the quietest and most pleasing sounds of all of the aftermarket brands we have seen. This Borla exhaust produces a deep rumble perfectly suited to the V8. It's a throaty sound that any American muscle car fan will appreciate. Yet it manages to be civilized and unobtrusive when needed. This system bolts on after the factory catalytic converters for an easy install. This system features a 3.0"" pipe diameter leading into the mufflers (2.25"" on exit) with 3.5"" tips.   Every Borla is made with 304 stainless steel for the internals and muffler body. Unlike other systems that can use coated aluminum, mild steel, or 409 stainless, the Borla uses true 304 stainless on the inside as well as the outside. This prevents the muffler from rusting and deteriorating from the inside out. Borla guarantees every muffler with a 1,000,000 mile warranty.

True to form, their cat-back system sounds exotic and beastly. It's a European supercar sound instead of American muscle. The Akrapovic Evolution exhaust is a high-flowing exhaust system, eliminating restriction from the mid-pipes to the rear muffler. The rear muffler incorporates two bypass valves to tailor the sound level to your needs. The mid-pipes and rear muffler are made from ultra-lightweight titanium with titanium tips. Mid ""Link"" Pipes: The Evolution link pipe set upgrades the Slip-On system to the Evolution system, which consists of a slip-on rear muffler and larger Evolution link pipe tubes with a middle muffler, all designed to make the performance and workmanship of the complete system as perfect as it looks. It is crafted entirely from titanium. The whole system is designed to provide the smoothest flow. The power and torque gains of the M2 Competition with the combination of the Slip-On Line system and Evolution link pipe set are guaranteed. In-depth engineering has produced a unique sound profile, distinctly different from the stock system, yielding a deep and sporty sound with no unwanted overtones or drone and an almost racing sound, as well as a significant change to the sound with the valves in the open or closed positions. The control kit to optimize the balance between sportiness and comfort is included, together with the receiver and Sound Remote controller (or smartphone app) to regulate the valves. When installing the Akrapovič Evolution link pipe set, remapping the ECU is mandatory in order to prevent potential “check engine light” warning signals. Muffler: The latest addition to the BMW M series is the awe-inspiring M2 Competition, an exquisite high-performance car that can be made even better by adding an Akrapovič Slip-On exhaust system. Made from titanium – with some parts cast in Akrapovič’s own foundry – this system will reduce the exhaust system's weight by over 45% and deliver extra power and lower backpressure. The sound has also been enhanced by Akrapovič’s engineers, delivering a true sporty tone especially in the middle and upper rpm range but without any droning. Titanium tailpipes give an added look to the rear of the M2 Competition to display its sporting potential. The 2012+ F12 M6 is one of the most impressive road cars ever created and the Akrapovic Evolution exhaust is the perfect enhancement. The new M TwinPower Turbo M6 has been a welcome challenge to the Akrapovi?

Complete Cat-Back Exhaust Made in the USA Lifetime Warranty TURNER Corsa Performance T-304 stainless exhaust system for 2001-2006 E46 M3. Features mandrel-bent tubing, polished quad 3"" tips, and drone-free quiet-cruising, thanks to patented Reflective Sound-Cancellation (RSC) technology. The Corsa system also eliminates the ""rasp"" characteristics of the stock exhaust sound. This rasp-elimination is accomplished just like the old ""Rasp-X"" product. This system is amazingly quiet during normal cruising, due to the ""no drone"" RSC technology, yet still has an aggressive presence and full sound while under throttle. This makes for ideal sound for those that want an aggressive ""roar"" while driving hard, yet still want a more discrete lower volume for normal cruising. (Please check out the video below for a sound sample). Reflective Sound-Cancellation (RSC) technology - This feature is a patented non-electrical noise control system, where engine sound (pressure) waves are reflected in passages inside the muffler 180 degrees out of phase to cancel out unwanted sound waves. The result is a tuned muffler that ""cleans up"" the noise without eliminating the pure sound of power associated with a high-performance vehicle. Using the Corsa technology, the stainless steel mufflers are tuned to eliminate passenger cabin resonance and produce just the ""right"" sound. The result is quieter cruising with an awe-inspiring roar at full throttle. This system is amazingly quiet during normal cruising, due to the ""no drone"" RSC technology, yet still has an aggressive presence and full sound while under throttle. This makes for ideal sound for those that want an aggressive ""roar"" while driving hard, yet still want a more discrete lower volume for normal cruising. This is a complete system from the catalytic converter back. On the E46 M3 the factory catalytic converter is located in the exhaust manifold. This system will bolt to the manifold and use all of the factory hangers. It's very easy and straightforward to install and the stock exhaust can be removed from the car as one piece, saving time and hassle. No cutting or welding is required for install. Detailed photographic instructions are included. This system is 100% Made in the USA and carries a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer.

The new M TwinPower Turbo M6 has been a welcome challenge to the Akrapovic R&D department, which is responsible for developing truly amazing exhaust system that offers more power, weighs less, and has an EC type-approval stamp at the same time. Mid ""Link"" Pipes: The Evolution link pipe set upgrades the Slip-On system to the Evolution system, which consists of a slip-on rear muffler and larger Evolution link pipe tubes with a middle muffler, all designed to make the performance and workmanship of the complete system as perfect as it looks. It is crafted entirely from titanium. The whole system is designed to provide the smoothest flow. The power and torque gains of the M2 Competition with the combination of the Slip-On Line system and Evolution link pipe set are guaranteed. In-depth engineering has produced a unique sound profile, distinctly different from the stock system, yielding a deep and sporty sound with no unwanted overtones or drone and an almost racing sound, as well as a significant change to the sound with the valves in the open or closed positions. The control kit to optimize the balance between sportiness and comfort is included, together with the receiver and Sound Remote controller (or smartphone app) to regulate the valves. When installing the Akrapovič Evolution link pipe set, remapping the ECU is mandatory in order to prevent potential “check engine light” warning signals. Muffler: The latest addition to the BMW M series is the awe-inspiring M2 Competition, an exquisite high-performance car that can be made even better by adding an Akrapovič Slip-On exhaust system. Made from titanium – with some parts cast in Akrapovič’s own foundry – this system will reduce the exhaust system's weight by over 45% and deliver extra power and lower backpressure. The sound has also been enhanced by Akrapovič’s engineers, delivering a true sporty tone especially in the middle and upper rpm range but without any droning. Carbon-fibre tailpipes give an added look to the rear of the M2 Competition to display its sporting potential. The Akrapovic system includes muffler valves for both outlets (the stock system only uses one on the driver side). A valve controller and wiring harness are included to operate both valves from the stock wiring. This allows you to preserve the stock operation of the valves in Comfort, Sport, and Sport+ modes."

This system was designed and engineered by tuning the perfect tube lengths, ultimately maximizing performance across the power band while maintaining a great tone. Also included is an X-pipe balance tube which equalizes and evenly distributes exhaust pulses for increased flow and minimizing exhaust drone. To finish off this system, aFe uses four 4"" polished tips with 303 stainless steel machined finish inserts. This exhaust uses all factory hanger locations for a hassle-free installation. No modifications necessary.    All aFe exhaust systems are engineered and manufactured in our Corona, California manufacturing facility.     An X-pipe balance tube is used to equalize and evenly distribute exhaust pulses which minimizes exhaust drone and increases flow and performance.     Mitered collectors decrease turbulence and increase exhaust velocity resulting in increased horsepower, torque and improved throttle response.     High quality OE style flanges and band clamps are used for a complete 360 degree sealing surface.

We sell this as a complete exhaust upgrade - everything you need to change over to the M5 Comp Package mufflers. BMW engineered the mufflers to be replaceable. That makes this install very simple and can be done with the rest of the exhaust still attached to the car. And the swap is not permanent; you can revert back to the stock exhaust at any time. Install time should be about one hour.   Included with our Comp Package exhaust upgrade:

In recent testing, this system produced 4 horsepower and 8 lbs. x ft. of torque. This exhaust is constructed from 2.5"" brushed finish, mandrel bent, 304 stainless steel and is TIG-welded. A high flow, 304 stainless steel, single in dual out muffler was used to maximize performance across the power band while maintaining a great tone. To finish off this exhaust are dual, aFe laser etched, 3"" polished 304 stainless steel tips. This exhaust uses all factory hanger locations. Note: Cutting is required and should be performed by a skilled technician.   All aFe exhaust systems are engineered and manufactured in our Corona, California manufacturing facility.     The rear cats are retained on this system to maintain a smooth, deep sound but more importantly to keep the system street legal.     Mitered collectors decrease turbulence and increase exhaust velocity resulting in increased horsepower, torque and improved throttle response.     High quality band clamps are used for a complete 360 degree sealing surface.     A 16"" free-flowing muffler is used to absorb high pitch tones producing a powerful sound and unleashing all available horsepower and torque.

Our Exhaust system sports Mandrel bent dual 2.5” 304SS pipes with a nice brushed finish. Exhaust gases flow through efficient piping to High flow, valved, stainless steel mufflers. Under normal driving conditions, the vacuum controlled muffler valves stay closed, and the exhaust is quite unassuming. Nobody will really even suspect your car even has an aftermarket exhaust system, as it sounds nearly identical to the factory system. But, when you open up the throttle, the vacuum controlled valves open up, and this exhaust gives your car a menacing growl. Designed to mount using the factory exhaust hangers, this exhaust is a bolt-on replacement for the OE version. To help reduce the time you spend installing the system, Accuseal slip-fit joints are included to make fitment as easy as possible. The Turner Motorsport full exhaust system includes a High flow, valved, stainless-steel muffler, and is available as an axle-back or cat-back system!

The difference is very noticeable and absolutely reinforces the M car character that the stock exhaust is lacking. The Comp Package exhaust has a lot of the same sounds as other M6 performance mufflers - it pops and burbles and growls but is still a refined sound. It's just as you would expect from BMW's Motorsport engineers. This might be the best solution for owners looking for a more aggressive sound but don't want the loudest exhaust on the block.   We sell this as a complete exhaust upgrade - everything you need to change over to the M6 Comp Package mufflers. BMW engineered the mufflers to be replaceable. That makes this install very simple and can be done with the rest of the exhaust still attached to the car. And the swap is not permanent; you can revert back to the stock exhaust at any time. Install time should be about one hour.   Included with our Comp Package exhaust upgrade:

The Corsa sport muffler manages to be raucous and aggressive but not obnoxious or out of character for the svelte E36. It's amazing that so much sound can come from just a rear muffler section but Corsa's straight-through design and Reflective Sound Cancellation (RSC) produce a throaty sound that still sounds good and with NO DRONE.   When driven aggressively it produces a throaty and charismatic exhaust note. It has plenty of burbles and pops that a performance exhaust should have and compliments other performance upgrades you may have on your car. But when driven lightly there's only a slight hint of sporty sound. It becomes a subdued version of its other self and completely livable on daily and highway trips without any droning. You can use it on a daily driver without it being annoying or intrusive and then let it off its leash for the weekend fun runs.   Reflective Sound-Cancellation (RSC) technology - This feature is a patented non-electrical noise control system, where engine sound (pressure) waves are reflected in passages inside the muffler 180 degrees out of phase to cancel out unwanted sound waves. The result is a tuned muffler that ""cleans up"" the noise without eliminating the pure sound of power associated with a high-performance vehicle. Using the Corsa technology, the stainless steel mufflers are tuned to eliminate passenger cabin resonance and produce just the ""right"" sound. The result is quieter cruising with an awe-inspiring roar at full throttle. This system is amazingly quiet during normal cruising, due to the ""no drone"" RSC technology, yet still has an aggressive presence and full sound while under throttle. This makes for ideal sound for those that want an aggressive ""roar"" while driving hard, yet still want a more discrete lower volume for normal cruising.   This is a cat-back system, which replaces the exhaust piping and muffler from the catalytic converter. It's very easy and straightforward to install and the rest of the exhaust can remain on the car. Detailed photographic instructions are included. This system is 100% Made in the USA and carries a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. This exhaust is emissions legal in all 50 states (no effect whatsoever on emissions, and no ""Check Engine"" warning lights).               1992-1998    325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3"

Borla makes a Street and Race version of this exhaust with the Street being a noticeable but moderate sound easily tolerated for daily driver use. The Street (Touring) exhaust is perfect for someone who wants to hear a bit more of the engine without waking up the neighborhood or annoying the car next to you in traffic. It suits the character of the Cooper S very well. Borla builds this exhaust as a full cat-back system with dual rear mufflers. It's also about 10lbs lighter than the stock original system.   Every Borla is made with 304 stainless steel for the internals and muffler body. Unlike other systems that can use coated aluminum, mild steel, or 409 stainless, the Borla uses true 304 stainless on the inside as well as the outside. This prevents the muffler from rusting and deteriorating from the inside out. Borla guarantees every muffler with a 1,000,000 mile warranty. Turner Motorsport has been the leading Borla dealer for BMW exhausts since we sold our first system in 1996, including using Borla Exhausts on every Turner BMW racecar.     2005-2008    MINI Cooper S Convertible.   2004-2006    MINI Cooper S"
