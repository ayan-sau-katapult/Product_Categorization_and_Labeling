APEX light alloy wheels are the next evolution in flow-forged wheel technology for BMWs. Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front.

Running as a square setup will allow you to use a rotatable tire set which saves tire life and gives more neutral handling. We have worked with Forgeline - the wheel supplier to our Grand-Am race team - so that these wheels are the 10"" width and the perfect offset to fit with no rubbing or clearance issues.     Forgeline wheels are designed for strength and performance, and are built to meet the extreme demands of sports car racing. Our Rolex GT and Continental Sports Car Challenge GS M3s use Forgeline wheels and they are favored by many sports, GT, and Prototype teams in Grand Am, ALMS, SCCA, and virtually every amateur sports car series in the US. The GZ3R is Forgeline's latest forged competition wheel and an evolution of the previous ZX3R. The new wheel has the same design and look as before but now uses hidden stainless steel ARP hardware for a smoother and clearner appearance (and easier to clean!). The forged wheel center also has all unnecessary aluminum removed to reduce the weight as much as possible without sacrificing strength. The rim material is lighter and stronger, thanks to the use of 6061-T6 aluminum. And for even further weight reduction opt for the titanium fasteners (optional, +$75 each wheel). On our Project M3s, we have run the ZX3R/GZ3R packages with 275/35-18 tires (front and rear) and have found this is simply the winning combination for the E9X M3. No rubbing or fender rolling required! If you're using a big brake kit, contact us directly so we can build your wheel to clear your brakes.     Stock BMW 18"" M3 wheels weigh 48lbs front and 51 lbs rear, with tires. The optional 19"" factory wheels are 47 lbs / 51 lbs with tires. This Forgeline package weighs only 43 lbs a corner with tires -- a weight savings of either 22 or 24 lbs over stock.   This package includes four (4) 18x10"" ForgeLine GZ3R competition wheels in your choice of custom finish and options. These wheels are built to order for each customer, without the long wait time.

It's no wonder that you'll find so many cars at track events with LTW5 wheels.

D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.   These D-Force wheels use the BMW 4-lug 4/100 bolt pattern and with a 57.1mm center bore. These wheels fit the E30 318/325 models as well as other vintage BMWs that use the 4/100 bolt pattern.

The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.

The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels.

APEX light alloy wheels are the next evolution in flow-forged wheel technology for BMWs. Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore.

It's no wonder that you'll find so many cars at track events with LTW5 wheels. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.

D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean!

The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.   The Heritage LS3 wheel is a 3-piece mesh design with design cues from the iconic BBS RS and BMW Style 5 wheels. This mesh design was almost made for German automobiles, but especially BMW. They just look right and correct for all generations of BMW styling where they compliment BMW's creased and sharp edged lines. These really pop in a gold finish especially in a contrasting black, red, or even white body color. These wheels look best with a medium or large outer polished lip. The complicated mesh design, exposed hardware, and polished lip give the wheel a lot of 'bling' but this design looks right at home on any BMW.   Forgeline's 3-piece wheels consist of the inner barrel, wheel face, and outer lip. Each is milled from aviation-grade 6061-T6 aluminum. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. On a wheel with hidden fasteners the wheel center is pressed with Heli-Coil inserts. This is a better and more durable method than tapping the aluminum itself. Stainless steel ARP hardware holds the pieces together. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This LS3 wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required. Because Forgeline wheels are custom manufactured, returns or refunds are not available.

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future.CX wheels consist of a pressure cast wheel surface and a flow formed rim structure.  Combining these two fabrication techniques yields a wheel that is extremely strong while remaining lightweight.,"Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in Gloss Anthracite with a diamond cut face and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity.

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future.LM wheels consist of a pressure cast wheel surface and a flow formed rim structure.  Combining these two fabrication techniques yields a wheel that is extremely strong while remaining lightweight.,"Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in Diamond Silver with a diamond cut lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity. A final protective clear coat layer ensures that these wheels will be easy to clean and look amazing for years to come.",Specs:,,19x8.5 ET32 - qty 2,19x9.5 ET32 - qty 2,Diamond Silver with a diamond cut lip,Center Bore: PFS,Bolt Pattern: 5x120,,

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand. All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you. Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels.

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit many BMW models and may be used on other models with a specific wheel spacer. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels.

It's no wonder that you'll find so many cars at track events with LTW5 wheels. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car.

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future.RG-R style wheels combine a lightweight forged construction with an eye-catching yet tasteful design to bring you some of the finest two-piece wheels on the market. Forged wheels are created by crushing a solid block of aluminum into the desired shape using an extreme amount of pressure. This creates a wheel that is incredibly strong while remaining relatively lightweight. Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in a Diamond Silver painted finish with a diamond cut lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity.

Which means they are some of the strongest and lightest wheels you can find for your BMW. They also look amazing with the mesh ""Y-spoke"" design and polished outer lip blending with your BMW for a classis appearance. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. EmPower wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The EmPower uses the classic mesh pattern found on so many other German wheels and are a natural complement to BMW's heritage and styling cues. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.   These D-Force wheels with the low offsets are a direct fit to BMW E39 5-series that use the 5/120 bolt pattern with a 74.1mm center bore. It can also fit other 5/6/7-series models when used with a wheel centering ring. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used).

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future.RS style wheels combine a lightweight forged construction with an eye-catching yet tasteful design to bring you some of the finest two-piece wheels on the market. Forged wheels are created by crushing a solid block of aluminum into the desired shape using an extreme amount of pressure. This creates a wheel that is incredibly strong while remaining relatively lightweight. Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in a black painted finish with a diamond cut lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity. A final protective clear coat layer ensures that these wheels will be easy to clean and look amazing for years to come.",Specs:,,,19x9.5 RS Wheels - qty 4,Diamond Black,Offset: 35mm,Center Bore: PFS,Bolt Pattern: 5x120,,

These LTW5 alloy wheels have proven themselves again and again, year after year, as one of the best track wheels on the BMW market.   They tick all of the right boxes in wheel design -    These wheels have been a favorite of Turner customers and our Turner project cars for years. When we want to build an E36 M3 track car, we go with these. There's never been a better inexpensive track wheel.   The LTW5 are built using a new flow-forming casting process that results in a denser concentration of aluminum alloy in the casting. It's a semi-forged wheel at a fraction of the cost of a true forged wheel. This keeps it as one of the strongest wheels out there but with light weight. D-Force started out designing wheels    for BMWs so the fitment and design is second to none. These wheels were built for an excellent fit within the E36 and E46 bodywork and for clearance to the most common types of struts and coil overs. The spoke design and backspacing is also very generous for big brake kits and caliper upgrades which means you may not need spacers.     Front: 17x9.0 / ET 41 offset / 16.6lbs. Recommended tire size: 245-255Rear: 17x9.0 / ET 41 offset / 16.6lbs. Recommended tire size: 245-255     this is a very aggressive wheel for these applications. This wheel package is only intended for track or racecars that run very wide tires. Because of the widths and offsets involved, some tire contact and rubbing may occur on a suspension component or bodywork. We cannot guarantee fitment with all applications. Bodywork rubbing may have to be corrected with fender rolling, steering rack stops, or even a small spacer. Suspension contact will need to be corrected with spacers or alternative suspension components. If tire contact does concern you then we suggest using a narrower 8.5"" wheel.

Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. This is an excellent wheel for SpecE46 (SE46). The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve.

Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels.

APEX light alloy wheels are the next evolution in flow-forged wheel technology for BMWs. Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels.

APEX light alloy wheels are the next evolution in flow-forged wheel technology for BMWs. Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

Which means they are some of the strongest and lightest wheels you can find for your BMW. They also look amazing with the mesh ""Y-spoke"" design and polished outer lip blending with your BMW for a classis appearance. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. EmPower wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The EmPower uses the classic mesh pattern found on so many other German wheels and are a natural complement to BMW's heritage and styling cues.

This creates a wheel that is incredibly strong while remaining relatively lightweight. Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in a silver painted finish with a diamond cut lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity.

EmPower wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The EmPower uses the classic mesh pattern found on so many other German wheels and are a natural complement to BMW's heritage and styling cues. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve.

The FF15 comes in 18""-20"" sizes but appear larger thanks to the long straight spokes that run right to the edge of the rim. The correct offsets locate the wheel in just the right position without the need for spacers and maintaining the proper clearances to the body, brakes, and suspension. The standard 18"" color is Tarmac (black) with eleven optional finishes available too.The FlowForm process is new technology with the attributes of a fully forged wheel but at a lower cost. FlowForm starts as a cast face and the barrel is then spin formed over a mold at intense pressure.

Some of the factory wheels are a nice complement to BMW's styling but fail to really emphasize and amplify the F30's sharp edged lines. The V-FF 103 wheels very closely resemble the Vorsteiner VSE-003 and VTM-352 forged wheels. Vorsteiner is on the cutting edge of BMW styling enhancements and their new award-winning Flow Forged wheels are in a class of their own. Vorsteiner aero upgrades and wheels have been featured on many of our latest project and show cars. The V FF wheels strike all the right chords for style, fitment, technology, and quality.   On our F30 and F80 project cars we experimented with several wheel designs and sizes. Both chassis are begging for a large wheel that makes a dominating presence. The 20"" V-FF 103 is our favorite sizing thanks to its powerful visual punch but 19"" is also available and offers more tire choices. Ride quality is improved with some 19"" tires compared to 20"". Both sizes come in staggered widths of 9.5"" front and 10.5"" rear with aggressive offsets that negate the need for spacers. The wheels sit right to the fender lip. The face of each wheel has been tailored to emphasize the muscular stance of the M3/M4. The front wheels have a moderate concave dish and the rear wheels have a deep concave inset. Sculpting of the wheel spokes ensures compatibility with iron and composite brakes. These have been meticulously designed and engineered to give a strong, muscular stance without going over the edge.   Three gloss metallic colors are available to tie into your car's palette - Mercury Silver, Carbon Graphite, and Mystic Black. Each color can complement the rest of the trim on your car. Use the Mystic Black to tie in together with your satin black grilles and trim. Or the Mercury Silver can really pop when used on a black or grey body color and matte black trim.   The V-FF 103 is part of Vorsteiner's new Flow Forged wheel series. Until recently, their high quality wheel line was made up exclusively of forged alloy options whose fitment, quality and beauty set the bar for high end wheels. The Flow Forged wheels use a manufacturing process similar to casting but with the strength of a fully forged wheel. The final product is light weight but very strong and the V-FF wheels are fully tested and certified to rigorous safety standards. The manufacturing process is the latest in advanced wheel production but still less expensive than a fully forged wheel so you get all of the attributes of a forged monoblock wheel at a third of the price!

Some of the factory wheels are a nice complement to BMW's styling but fail to really emphasize and amplify the F30's sharp edged lines. The V-FF 103 wheels very closely resemble the Vorsteiner VSE-003 and VTM-352 forged wheels. Vorsteiner is on the cutting edge of BMW styling enhancements and their new award-winning Flow Forged wheels are in a class of their own. Vorsteiner aero upgrades and wheels have been featured on many of our latest project and show cars. The V FF wheels strike all the right chords for style, fitment, technology, and quality.   On our F30 and F80 project cars we experimented with several wheel designs and sizes. Both chassis are begging for a large wheel that makes a dominating presence. The 20"" V-FF 103 is our favorite sizing thanks to its powerful visual punch but 19"" is also available and offers more tire choices. Ride quality is improved with some 19"" tires compared to 20"". Both sizes come in staggered widths of 8.5"" front and 10"" rear with aggressive offsets that negate the need for spacers. The wheels sit right to the fender lip. The front wheels have a moderate concave dish and the rear wheels have a deep concave inset. Sculpting of the wheel spokes ensures compatibility with iron and composite brakes. These have been meticulously designed and engineered to give a strong, muscular stance without going over the edge.   Three gloss metallic colors are available to tie into your car's palette - Mercury Silver, Carbon Graphite, and Mystic Black. Each color can complement the rest of the trim on your car. Use the Mystic Black to tie in together with your satin black grilles and trim. Or the Mercury Silver can really pop when used on a black or grey body color and matte black trim.   The V-FF 103 is part of Vorsteiner's new Flow Forged wheel series. Until recently, their high quality wheel line was made up exclusively of forged alloy options whose fitment, quality and beauty set the bar for high end wheels. The Flow Forged wheels use a manufacturing process similar to casting but with the strength of a fully forged wheel. The final product is light weight but very strong and the V-FF wheels are fully tested and certified to rigorous safety standards. The manufacturing process is the latest in advanced wheel production but still less expensive than a fully forged wheel so you get all of the attributes of a forged monoblock wheel at a third of the price!

It's no wonder that you'll find so many cars at track events with LTW5 wheels. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.   These D-Force wheels use the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

HRE designs are cutting edge and exciting and are featured on the hottest street machines from SoCal to South Beach. Now the FF15's sharp looks can be applied to a track wheel setup. 18x8.5"" wheels are great for 245-255 tires which are available in many track and high performance tire compounds. Using a wide wheel/tire in the front will give more grip and reduce premature understeer. It's one of the keys to getting better handing on almost any BMW. These sizes and offsets run more aggressive than what is typically found on a street car but necessary to get as much rubber as possible to fit within the bodywork. On the F22, more negative camber may be required depending on the tire choice (to clear the fender lip). The HRE FlowForm wheel line offers forged wheel strength and HRE's stimulating designs at a more attractive price.The FF15 is a multispoke wheel (15 spokes) very similar to HRE's C109 forged 3-piece wheel. The FF15 comes in 18""-20"" sizes but appear larger thanks to the long straight spokes that run right to the edge of the rim. The correct offsets locate the wheel in just the right position without the need for spacers and maintaining the proper clearances to the body, brakes, and suspension. The standard 18"" color is Tarmac (black) with eleven optional finishes available to. Contact us for other sizes.The FlowForm process is new technology with the attributes of a fully forged wheel but at a lower cost. FlowForm starts as a cast face and the barrel is then spin formed over a mold at intense pressure. This gives the wheel greater strength but lighter in weight and with more precise tolerances than a traditional cast wheel.

APEX light alloy wheels are the next evolution in flow-forged wheel technology for BMWs. Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car.

FF01 wheels are available in 19"" and 20"" sizes that fit with the proper offset (no spacers required). Concave centers emphasize the muscular and athletic stance while two standard and eleven optional finishes trigger the visual impact.The FlowForm process is new technology with the attributes of a fully forged wheel but at a lower cost.

HRE designs are cutting edge and exciting and are featured on the hottest street machines from SoCal to South Beach. The HRE FlowForm wheel line offers forged wheel strength and HRE's stimulating designs at a more attractive price.HRE FF01 FlowForm wheels are a Y-spoke design instantly familiar and at-home on BMWs. The FF01 closely resembles the famous CSL or ZCP factory designs but with distinct details and more desirable sizes and offsets. FF01 wheels are available in 19"" and 20"" sizes that fit with the proper offset (no spacers required). Concave centers emphasize the muscular and athletic stance while two standard and eleven optional finishes trigger the visual impact.The FlowForm process is new technology with the attributes of a fully forged wheel but at a lower cost. FlowForm starts as a cast face and the barrel is then spin formed over a mold at intense pressure. This gives the wheel greater strength but lighter in weight and with more precise tolerances than a traditional cast wheel. HRE FF wheels are TUV, VIA, and JWL approved and come with a lifetime structural warranty and two-year finish warranty.HRE FlowForm Wheel Features -+ state-of-the-art technology+ lighter and stronger than a cast wheel+ stimulating looks+ multiple color and finish options encourage personalization+ lifetime structural warranty+ TUV, VIA, and JWL approvedColors and Finishes -",Show More,Show Less,Standard Colors,Optional Colors (+$500),2015+  M3 - Sedan2015+  M4 - Coupe2015+  M4 - Convertible,Call us at  if you are interested in custom color options!,1.800.280.6966,This item fits the following BMWs:,F80 BMW,,,,

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

Forgeline's greatest attributes is their obsessive attention to detail and commitment to quality. They produce exciting and innovative wheel designs that stir the passions of automotive enthusiasts from every segment. Forgeline is world-renowned as a manufacturer of advanced forged alloy wheels that find their way to show-stopping project vehicles as well as the winner's circle of major racing events. Forgeline Wheels are an extension of your own automotive style and taste and that's why every Forgeline wheel set is custom-tailored. You become the wheel designer providing the finishing touch or the inspiration for a great build. The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.This SE1 wheel set is built specifically for the E90/E92 M3 chassis with sizes and offsets for an aggressive fitment with minimal clearance issues. We have sized these wheels to be bigger than stock but with staggered sizes to maintain a muscular and purposeful look. One of the best attributes for a custom wheel is that spacers are not required. Wheel caps are included or the wheel can be custom made to use the factory BMW center cap. You can re-use your original BMW wheel bolts or pick up a fresh set from our options below. We can also mount and balance your tires prior to shipping. TPMS brackets are included as well (sensors additional if required). Because Forgeline Wheels are custom made to order, typical production lead time is 2-3 weeks.The one-piece monoblock wheels feature the strength of racing wheels with fewer pieces for reduced weight. Additional machining, and Forgeline's ""I-beam"" spoke technology further reduce weight without compromising stiffness. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. Forgeline starts with a block of 6061-T6 aluminum that is CNC-milled to the style and specs of the customer's order. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. This is a 1-piece wheel so outer lip and inner barrel finishes will match whichever wheel center you choose. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This SE1 wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

It's no wonder that you'll find so many cars at track events with LTW5 wheels. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.   These D-Force wheels use the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front.

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future. LM wheels consist of a pressure cast wheel surface and a flow-formed rim structure. Combining these two fabrication techniques yields a wheel that is extremely strong while remaining lightweight. Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins. Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost. Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input. These wheels come in Gold with a diamond cut lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity. A final protective clear coat layer ensures that these wheels will be easy to clean and look amazing for years to come.

Forgeline's greatest attributes is their obsessive attention to detail and commitment to quality. They produce exciting and innovative wheel designs that stir the passions of automotive enthusiasts from every segment. Forgeline is world-renowned as a manufacturer of advanced forged alloy wheels that find their way to show-stopping project vehicles as well as the winner's circle of major racing events. Forgeline Wheels are an extension of your own automotive style and taste and that's why every Forgeline wheel set is custom-tailored. You become the wheel designer providing the finishing touch or the inspiration for a great build. The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.    This GA1R wheel set is built specifically for the E60 M5 chassis with sizes and offsets for an aggressive fitment with minimal clearance issues. We have sized these wheels to be bigger than stock but with staggered sizes to maintain a muscular and purposeful look. One of the best attributes for a custom wheel is that spacers are not required. Wheel caps are included or the wheel can be custom made to use the factory BMW center cap. You can re-use your original BMW wheel bolts or pick up a fresh set from our options below. We can also mount and balance your tires prior to shipping. TPMS brackets are included as well (sensors additional if required). Because Forgeline Wheels are custom made to order, typical production lead time is 2-3 weeks.   The one-piece monoblock wheels feature the strength of racing wheels with fewer pieces for reduced weight. The ""GA"" in the GA1R name actually comes from the 'Grand-Am' racing series where Forgeline Wheels can be found on Prototype, GT, and GS racecars. Additional machining, and Forgeline's ""I-beam"" spoke technology further reduce weight without compromising stiffness. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. Forgeline starts with a block of 6061-T6 aluminum that is CNC-milled to the style and specs of the customer's order. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. This is a 1-piece wheel so outer lip and inner barrel finishes will match whichever wheel center you choose. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This GA1R wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required. Because Forgeline wheels are custom manufactured, returns or refunds are not available. For additional resources on wheel fitments, refer to our    (http://www.turnermotorsport.com/t-wheel_guide.aspx) or give us a call or e-mail.

The FF15 is a multispoke wheel (15 spokes) very similar to HRE's C109 forged 3-piece wheel. The FF15 comes in 18""-20"" sizes but appear larger thanks to the long straight spokes that run right to the edge of the rim.

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve.

Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in Gold with a diamond cut lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity.

The FF01 closely resembles the famous CSL or ZCP factory designs but with distinct details and more desirable sizes and offsets. FF01 wheels are available in 19"" and 20"" sizes that fit with the proper offset (no spacers required). Concave centers emphasize the muscular and athletic stance while two standard and eleven optional finishes trigger the visual impact. The FlowForm process is new technology with the attributes of a fully forged wheel but at a lower cost. FlowForm starts as a cast face and the barrel is then spin formed over a mold at intense pressure. This gives the wheel greater strength but lighter in weight and with more precise tolerances than a traditional cast wheel.

Forgeline's greatest attributes is their obsessive attention to detail and commitment to quality. They produce exciting and innovative wheel designs that stir the passions of automotive enthusiasts from every segment. Forgeline is world-renowned as a manufacturer of advanced forged alloy wheels that find their way to show-stopping project vehicles as well as the winner's circle of major racing events. Forgeline Wheels are an extension of your own automotive style and taste and that's why every Forgeline wheel set is custom-tailored. You become the wheel designer providing the finishing touch or the inspiration for a great build. The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.    This GA1R wheel set is built specifically for the E90/E92 M3 chassis with sizes and offsets for an aggressive fitment with minimal clearance issues. We have sized these wheels to be bigger than stock but with staggered sizes to maintain a muscular and purposeful look. One of the best attributes for a custom wheel is that spacers are not required. Wheel caps are included or the wheel can be custom made to use the factory BMW center cap. You can re-use your original BMW wheel bolts or pick up a fresh set from our options below. We can also mount and balance your tires prior to shipping. TPMS brackets are included as well (sensors additional if required). Because Forgeline Wheels are custom made to order, typical production lead time is 2-3 weeks.   The one-piece monoblock wheels feature the strength of racing wheels with fewer pieces for reduced weight. The ""GA"" in the GA1R name actually comes from the 'Grand-Am' racing series where Forgeline Wheels can be found on Prototype, GT, and GS racecars. Additional machining, and Forgeline's ""I-beam"" spoke technology further reduce weight without compromising stiffness. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. Forgeline starts with a block of 6061-T6 aluminum that is CNC-milled to the style and specs of the customer's order. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. This is a 1-piece wheel so outer lip and inner barrel finishes will match whichever wheel center you choose. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This GA1R wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required. Because Forgeline wheels are custom manufactured, returns or refunds are not available. For additional resources on wheel fitments, refer to our    (http://www.turnermotorsport.com/t-wheel_guide.aspx) or give us a call or e-mail.

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future.CH-R wheels consist of a pressure cast wheel surface and a flow formed rim structure.  Combining these two fabrication techniques yields a wheel that is extremely strong while remaining lightweight.,Show More,Show Less,"Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in a Titanium painted finish with a polished lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity. A final protective clear coat layer ensures that these wheels will be easy to clean and look amazing for years to come.","Please Note: Aggressive fitment, may require fender rolling/pulling.",Specs:,18x8 ET40 - qty 2,18x9 ET44 - qty2,Titanium,Center Bore: PFS,Bolt Pattern: 5x120,,,

Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in Satin Titanium and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity.

Some of the factory wheels are a nice complement to BMW's styling but fail to really emphasize and amplify the F10's sharp edged lines. The V-FF 103 wheels very closely resemble the Vorsteiner VSE-003 and VTM-352 forged wheels. Vorsteiner is on the cutting edge of BMW styling enhancements and their new award-winning Flow Forged wheels are in a class of their own. Vorsteiner aero upgrades and wheels have been featured on many of our latest project and show cars. The V FF wheels strike all the right chords for style, fitment, technology, and quality.   We have tested multiple wheel sets on the F10 5-series and the broad shouldered styling begs for a larger wheel. Nothing can make more of a statement than wheels that are perfectly proportioned to the rest of the body. The 20"" Vorsteiner V-FF 103 wheels are bold and striking. They are a beautiful wheel design that does not look out of place or screaming for attention. Both sizes come in staggered widths of 9.0"" front and 10.5"" rear with aggressive offsets that negate the need for spacers. The wheels sit right to the fender lip. The rear wheels have a concave dish profile that further emphasizes the RWD bias on the F10 (front wheels have a slight concavity). Sculpting of the wheel spokes ensures compatibility with many big brake kits. These have been meticulously designed and engineered to give a strong, muscular stance without going over the edge.   Three gloss metallic colors are available to tie into your car's palette - Mercury Silver, Carbon Graphite, and Mystic Black. Each color can complement the rest of the trim on your car. Use the Mystic Black to tie in together with your satin black grilles and trim. Or the Mercury Silver can really pop when used on a black or grey body color and matte black trim.   The V-FF 103 is part of Vorsteiner's new Flow Forged wheel series. Until recently, their high quality wheel line was made up exclusively of forged alloy options whose fitment, quality and beauty set the bar for high end wheels. The Flow Forged wheels use a manufacturing process similar to casting but with the strength of a fully forged wheel. The final product is light weight but very strong and the V-FF wheels are fully tested and certified to rigorous safety standards. The manufacturing process is the latest in advanced wheel production but still less expensive than a fully forged wheel so you get all of the attributes of a forged monoblock wheel at a third of the price!

They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

The Vorsteiner 102 wheel shares its styling with the more expensive forged Vorsteiner VSR-163 and VSC-103 wheels. The V-FF 102 instantly attracts attention and will not be lost in the crowd. The sizing and aggressive offsets cement this style as one of the best for the F10.   On our F10 M5 project car we experimented with several wheel designs and sizes. The tall flanks are begging for a large wheel that makes a dominating presence. Vorsteiner feels the same way and the VFF102 wheels are a knockout on the F10 with 20"" and 21"" sizes.

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future.RS style wheels combine a lightweight forged construction with an eye-catching yet tasteful design to bring you some of the finest two-piece wheels on the market. Forged wheels are created by crushing a solid block of aluminum into the desired shape using an extreme amount of pressure. This creates a wheel that is incredibly strong while remaining relatively lightweight. Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in a silver painted finish with a diamond cut lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity. A final protective clear coat layer ensures that these wheels will be easy to clean and look amazing for years to come.",Show More,Show Less,Specs:,"Please Note: Aggressive fitment, may require fender rolling/pulling.",,"18""x8.5 ET38 - qty 2","18""x9.5"" ET40 - qty 2",Diamond Silver,Center Bore: 72.5mm,Bolt Pattern: 5x120,,,

Forgeline's greatest attributes is their obsessive attention to detail and commitment to quality. They produce exciting and innovative wheel designs that stir the passions of automotive enthusiasts from every segment. Forgeline is world-renowned as a manufacturer of advanced forged alloy wheels that find their way to show-stopping project vehicles as well as the winner's circle of major racing events. Forgeline Wheels are an extension of your own automotive style and taste and that's why every Forgeline wheel set is custom-tailored. You become the wheel designer providing the finishing touch or the inspiration for a great build. The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.   This SE1 wheel set is built specifically for the E60 M5 chassis with sizes and offsets for an aggressive fitment with minimal clearance issues. We have sized these wheels to be bigger than stock but with staggered sizes to maintain a muscular and purposeful look. One of the best attributes for a custom wheel is that spacers are not required. Wheel caps are included or the wheel can be custom made to use the factory BMW center cap. You can re-use your original BMW wheel bolts or pick up a fresh set from our options below. We can also mount and balance your tires prior to shipping. TPMS brackets are included as well (sensors additional if required). Because Forgeline Wheels are custom made to order, typical production lead time is 2-3 weeks.   The one-piece monoblock wheels feature the strength of racing wheels with fewer pieces for reduced weight. Additional machining, and Forgeline's ""I-beam"" spoke technology further reduce weight without compromising stiffness. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. Forgeline starts with a block of 6061-T6 aluminum that is CNC-milled to the style and specs of the customer's order. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. This is a 1-piece wheel so outer lip and inner barrel finishes will match whichever wheel center you choose. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This SE1 wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required. Because Forgeline wheels are custom manufactured, returns or refunds are not available. For additional resources on wheel fitments, refer to our    (http://www.turnermotorsport.com/t-wheel_guide.aspx) or give us a call or e-mail.

For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

If you're taking your F80 M3/F82 M4 to the track you know how important good rubber is. Getting as much rubber to the pavement is key for putting the torque to the pavement and for balanced handling. This M3/M4 square wheel set is the perfect choice for track enthusiasts who want to have a dedicated wheel/tire setup for track use. It's an 18x10"" square set in the correct offsets for the perfect fit with no rubbing or clearance issues (even with lowered springs). We use Forgeline forged alloy wheels on our IMSA race cars and chose the new monoblock GS1R competition wheel for the F8X 18x10 square set.","Running as a square setup will allow you to use a rotatable tire set which saves tire life and gives more neutral handling. Forgeline wheels are designed for strength and performance, and are built to meet the extreme demands of sports car racing. Our IMSA/United Sports Car and Continental Sports Car Challenge GS M3s use Forgeline wheels and they are favored by many sports, GT, and Prototype teams in IMSA, Grand Am, ALMS, SCCA, and virtually every amateur sports car series in the US. The GS1R is Forgeline's latest forged competition wheel and an evolution of their previous successful wheel designs. The fully forged monoblock wheel has all unnecessary aluminum removed to reduce the weight as much as possible without sacrificing strength. For simplicity and to save weight, these wheels do not use a center cap. The rim material is lighter and stronger, thanks to the use of 6061-T6 aluminum. On our Project M3s, we have run these 18x10"" wheels with 275/35-18 Continental slick tires (front and rear) and with no rubbing or fender rolling required! If you're using a big brake kit, contact us directly so we can build your wheel to clear your brakes. Multiple color and finish options are available - see the drop down menus below.","This package includes four (4) 18x10"" ForgeLine GS1R competition wheels in your choice of custom finish and options.

It's no wonder that you'll find so many cars at track events with LTW5 wheels. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.These D-Force wheels use the BMW 4-lug 4/100 bolt pattern and with a 57.1mm center bore. These wheels fit the E30 318/325 models as well as other vintage BMWs that use the 4/100 bolt pattern. Because they are light weight and very strong, this wheel is very popular wheel among the racing crowd. Used on many SpecE30 racecars.Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve.

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still lightweight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models.

Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand. All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore.

The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you. Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels.

This is a special set with 9.5"" wheels at all four corners so you can run a wider front tire for more grip. With most track tire options classed as a 275 width tire, a 9.5 or 10.0"" wheel is ideal for the E46 M3 (275/30, 275/35, 275/40, etc). Our Grand-Am Cup E46 M3s used 9.5 wheels in front and rear with a 275/35-18 Hoosier. Using a non-staggered wheel set is the first step for any tracked M3. These wheels are light weight but strong, being formed from a special process that makes the alloy stronger and less porous than traditional casting methods. Thousands of the LTW5 wheels have been sold with zero complaints about strength, making these an unbeatable track wheel option. They're even easy to clean! While running a square setup will help reduce understeer, there are other factors to consider as well in fine-tuning the handling to reduce understeer and create a more neutral car.     Front: 18x9.5 / ET 35 offset / 18.5lbs  Rear: 18x9.5 / ET 35 offset (requires 10mm spacer) / 18.5lbs  Because these wheels were built for more than one application, a 10mm spacer is required in the rear to maintain the factory wheel position and stance. This package of wheels includes the 10mm spacers and longer wheel bolts (remove the wheel bolts in the menu if you're running studs). When installing, ensure the spacer fits flush against the surface of the brake rotor hub. Minor trimming of the hub lip may be required for a completely flush fit.

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future.CH-R wheels consist of a pressure cast wheel surface and a flow formed rim structure.  Combining these two fabrication techniques yields a wheel that is extremely strong while remaining lightweight.,"Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come in a Titanium painted finish with a polished lip and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity. A final protective clear coat layer ensures that these wheels will be easy to clean and look amazing for years to come.",Specs:,,20x9 ET24 - qty 2,20x10.5 ET 24 - qty 2,Titanium,Center Bore: PFS,Bolt Pattern: 5x120,,

Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   These APEX wheels are made specifically for the BMW E30 and 4x100 bolt pattern with a 57.1mm center bore. They are a direct fit to the E30 with no spacers or hub adapters required. An original BMW center cap and original lug bolts are used with these wheels unless spacers are in place (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

Utilizing the most cutting-edge manufacturing technologies based on a foundation of constant innovation continues to propel BBS into the future.RF style wheels combine a lightweight forged construction with an eye-catching yet tasteful design to bring you some of the finest two-piece wheels on the market. Forged wheels are created by crushing a solid block of aluminum into the desired shape using an extreme amount of pressure. This creates a wheel that is incredibly strong while remaining relatively lightweight. Using FEM analysis the engineers at BBS are able to precisely measure and optimize wheel properties before this process even begins. Once the forging process is complete, the meticulous finish work begins.Back-milling is a process used to optimize the ratio between weight and stability. Using advanced computer analysis and a special CNC milling process the lateral parts that hold the wheel spokes, and are not relevant for stability, are removed. Extensive real-world simulation is used at this point to further ensure that no strength or stability has been lost.Finally, BBS pays special attention in machining the undercut or back side of the wheel. To machine the undercut, all areas on the inner side of the wheel and the star hub that correspond to weight optimization are processed with special turning or milling tools and excess material is removed to reduce the rotating wheel mass. Special attention is hereby given to the optimization of the inner sides of the spokes and the bolt circle. With the application of these methods, BBS is able to produce more complex forms with increased stability and less material input.These wheels come with a black painted finish and BBS ensures that their paint quality exceeds OE manufacturer specifications for durability and longevity. A final protective clear coat layer ensures that these wheels will be easy to clean and look amazing for years to come.",Specs:,Bolt Pattern: 5x120,,18x8 ET35 - qty 2,18x9 ET 47 - qty 2,Diamond Black,Offset: 35mm,Center Bore: 72.5mm,,

Forgeline's greatest attributes is their obsessive attention to detail and commitment to quality. They produce exciting and innovative wheel designs that stir the passions of automotive enthusiasts from every segment. Forgeline is world-renowned as a manufacturer of advanced forged alloy wheels that find their way to show-stopping project vehicles as well as the winner's circle of major racing events. Forgeline Wheels are an extension of your own automotive style and taste and that's why every Forgeline wheel set is custom-tailored. You become the wheel designer providing the finishing touch or the inspiration for a great build. The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.   This SE1 wheel set is built specifically for the E46 M3 chassis with sizes and offsets for an aggressive fitment with minimal clearance issues. The design is close to the E46 M3 CSL or ZCP wheels but we can build them in any size and offset that you want. The base package here has wheels that are bigger than stock but with staggered sizes to maintain a muscular and purposeful look. One of the best attributes for a custom wheel is that spacers are not required. Wheel caps are included or the wheel can be custom made to use the factory BMW center cap. You can re-use your original BMW wheel bolts or pick up a fresh set from our options below. We can also mount and balance your tires prior to shipping. Because Forgeline Wheels are custom made to order, typical production lead time is 2-3 weeks.   The one-piece monoblock wheels feature the strength of racing wheels with fewer pieces for reduced weight. Additional machining, and Forgeline's ""I-beam"" spoke technology further reduce weight without compromising stiffness. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. Forgeline starts with a block of 6061-T6 aluminum that is CNC-milled to the style and specs of the customer's order. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat instead of paint or anodize. Forgeline chose this process because it makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. This is a 1-piece wheel so outer lip and inner barrel finishes will match whichever wheel center you choose. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This SE1 wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required. Because Forgeline wheels are custom manufactured, returns or refunds are not available.

The rear wheels have a deep concave dish profile that further emphasizes the RWD bias on the E90/E92 styling. The front wheels also feature a moderate concave dish. Sculpting of the wheel spokes ensures compatibility with many big brake kits. These have been meticulously designed and engineered to give a strong, muscular stance without going over the edge.Three gloss metallic colors are available to tie into your car's palette - Mercury Silver, Carbon Graphite, and Mystic Black. Each color can complement the rest of the trim on your car. Use the Mystic Black to tie in together with your satin black grilles and trim.

Until recently, their high quality wheel line was made up exclusively of forged alloy options whose fitment, quality and beauty set the bar for high end wheels. The Flow Forged wheels use a manufacturing process similar to casting but with the strength of a fully forged wheel. The final product is light weight but very strong and the V-FF wheels are fully tested and certified to rigorous safety standards.

We can also mount and balance your tires prior to shipping. TPMS brackets are included as well (sensors additional if required). Because Forgeline Wheels are custom made to order, typical production lead time is 2-3 weeks.   The one-piece monoblock wheels feature the strength of racing wheels with fewer pieces for reduced weight. Additional machining, and Forgeline's ""I-beam"" spoke technology further reduce weight without compromising stiffness. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. Forgeline starts with a block of 6061-T6 aluminum that is CNC-milled to the style and specs of the customer's order. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. This is a 1-piece wheel so outer lip and inner barrel finishes will match whichever wheel center you choose. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This SE1 wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required. Because Forgeline wheels are custom manufactured, returns or refunds are not available.

APEX light alloy wheels are the next evolution in flow-forged wheel technology for BMWs. Flow-forming is a semi-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. In other words, these wheels are very impressively engineered and look great too! The design is based on classic motorsport themes that blend with BMW styling and appearance. These wheels look right at home on many BMW models. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack. Don't let the price fool you - these wheels are high quality, high strength, and in high demand.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

Forgeline's greatest attributes is their obsessive attention to detail and commitment to quality. They produce exciting and innovative wheel designs that stir the passions of automotive enthusiasts from every segment. Forgeline is world-renowned as a manufacturer of advanced forged alloy wheels that find their way to show-stopping project vehicles as well as the winner's circle of major racing events. Forgeline Wheels are an extension of your own automotive style and taste and that's why every Forgeline wheel set is custom-tailored. You become the wheel designer providing the finishing touch or the inspiration for a great build. The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.   Forgeline's Concave series of wheels delivers breathtaking presence and a 'deep' impression. The MS3C wheel is a 3-piece design in a classy multispoke pattern and hidden hardware. This is a Concave design with the 'dished' look (varies by offset and width). Details include full-length spokes that stretch to the wheel lip and bold chamfered spoke edges. The result is an exceptionally clean and impressive design.   Forgeline's 3-piece wheels consist of the inner barrel, wheel face, and outer lip. Each is milled from aviation-grade 6061-T6 aluminum. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. On a wheel with hidden fasteners like this MS3C the wheel center is pressed with Heli-Coil inserts. This is a better and more durable method than tapping the aluminum itself. Stainless steel ARP hardware holds the pieces together. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This MS3C wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

The PS-7 wheel is the result of APEX's extensive motorsport wheel experience applied to the unique demands of a street application. The PS-7 heavily borrows its looks from the EC-7 design but with key differences that make it more suitable for street use. PS-7 wheels have different offsets for a more aggressive stance and position in relation to the bodywork. In general, they stick out further compared to an EC-7 or ARC-8 style wheel so in many applications you can use a PS-7 without a wheel spacer. The engineering of the wheel's construction has changed to make them stronger when using low profile or stretched tire fitments. In addition, the thickness of the wheel lip has been increased. The spokes of the PS-7 extend all the way to the edge of the lip, making the wheel appear taller. APEX is proud to report the PS-7 has been approved for VIA certification - an independent organization in Japan that tests the strength of road wheels and a requirement for selling road wheels in Japan.   As with the other APEX wheels, the PS-7 are manufactured using a flow-forging process that produces a wheel typically stronger than a traditional cast wheel yet is still light weight. The wheels are around 10lbs lighter per wheel than a comparable factory wheel! That's reduced unsprung weight that improves all aspects of performance. The spokes and barrel have been designed to allow generous clearance for big brakes. Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car.   All APEX wheels are the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30, F32, F80, F82), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

This is a better and more durable method than tapping the aluminum itself. Stainless steel ARP hardware holds the pieces together. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This DE3C wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

This is a special set with 9.5"" wheels at all four corners so you can run a wider front tire for more grip. With most track tire options classed as a 275 width tire, a 9.5 or 10.0"" wheel is ideal for the E46 M3 (275/30, 275/35, 275/40, etc). Our Grand-Am Cup E46 M3s used 9.5 wheels in front and rear with a 275/35-18 Hoosier. Using a non-staggered wheel set is the first step for any tracked M3. These wheels are light weight but strong, being formed from a special process that makes the alloy stronger and less porous than traditional casting methods. Thousands of the LTW5 wheels have been sold with zero complaints about strength, making these an unbeatable track wheel option. They're even easy to clean! While running a square setup will help reduce understeer, there are other factors to consider as well in fine-tuning the handling to reduce understeer and create a more neutral car.     Front: 18x9.5 / ET 35 offset / 18.5lbs  Rear: 18x9.5 / ET 35 offset (requires 10mm spacer) / 18.5lbs  When installing, ensure the spacer fits flush against the surface of the brake rotor hub. Minor trimming of the hub lip may be required for a completely flush fit.

Forgeline's greatest attributes is their obsessive attention to detail and commitment to quality. They produce exciting and innovative wheel designs that stir the passions of automotive enthusiasts from every segment. Forgeline is world-renowned as a manufacturer of advanced forged alloy wheels that find their way to show-stopping project vehicles as well as the winner's circle of major racing events. Forgeline Wheels are an extension of your own automotive style and taste and that's why every Forgeline wheel set is custom-tailored. You become the wheel designer providing the finishing touch or the inspiration for a great build. The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.   Forgeline's Concave series of wheels delivers breathtaking presence and a 'deep' impression. The CF3C wheel is a 3-piece design with the classic broad five spoke pattern and hidden hardware. This is a Concave design with the 'dished' look (varies by offset and width). Details include full-length spokes that stretch to the wheel lip, bold chamfered spoke edges, the Forgeline logo machined into the the wheel center, and a stepped lip that makes the wheel center smaller (and lighter). A wide lip is also available. The result is an exceptionally clean and impressive design.   Forgeline's 3-piece wheels consist of the inner barrel, wheel face, and outer lip. Each is milled from aviation-grade 6061-T6 aluminum. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. On a wheel with hidden fasteners like this CF3C the wheel center is pressed with Heli-Coil inserts. This is a better and more durable method than tapping the aluminum itself. Stainless steel ARP hardware holds the pieces together. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This CF3C wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required. Because Forgeline wheels are custom manufactured, returns or refunds are not available.

This EmPower wheel set is a staggered fitment - 18x8.5 in the front and 18x9.5 in back. The front wheels are a half-inch wider than stock to allow a wider tire for more front end grip. The mesh styling of these wheels is drawn from other high end factory and aftermarket wheels so they almost look OEM. They are available in either silver or anthracite (dark grey) centers with a polished outer lip. And one of the best features of these wheels is their weight - under 21lbs for either a front or rear wheel! They are exceptionally strong too - using a flow forming casting and CNC process that is nearly as strong as a true forged wheel. If you've gotten a bit tired of the factory 18"" look, these are an exceptional alternative for the money! Price is for a set of two front and two rear wheels (includes rear centering ring). No spacers required! Add new center caps or ///M badge from the menu below.     Front: 18x8.5 / ET 40 offset / 19.2lbs. Recommended tire size: 235/35-255/35-18  Rear: 18x9.5 / ET 25 offset / 20.9lbs.

You become the wheel designer providing the finishing touch or the inspiration for a great build. The broad range of options and possibilities, limited only by your imagination, and the premium that true forged wheels demand virtually ensures exclusivity. Very few Forgeline sets will be entirely alike. We have been a Forgeline dealer for nearly twenty years and use them on our own Turner Motorsport race cars.   Forgeline's Concave series of wheels delivers breathtaking presence and a 'deep' impression. The DE3C wheel is a 3-piece design with the classic ""BBS-style"" mesh center and hidden hardware. This is a Concave design with the 'dished' look (varies by offset and width). Details include full-length spokes that stretch to the wheel lip, bold chamfered spoke edges, the Forgeline logo machined into the the wheel center, and a stepped lip that makes the wheel center smaller (and lighter). A wide lip is also available. The result is an exceptionally clean and impressive design.   Forgeline's 3-piece wheels consist of the inner barrel, wheel face, and outer lip. Each is milled from aviation-grade 6061-T6 aluminum. Each wheel design has been finite element tested to ensure strength under extreme conditions. The wheels are then polished by hand and checked for any imperfections. All wheels are powder coated then finished with a clear coat. This makes the wheel easy to clean and very durable. The powder coating is done in-house at Forgeline to ensure the highest quality and results. On a wheel with hidden fasteners like this DE3C the wheel center is pressed with Heli-Coil inserts. This is a better and more durable method than tapping the aluminum itself. Stainless steel ARP hardware holds the pieces together. Finally, each wheel is checked for run-out to within .020"" of true.   Forgeline prides itself on building wheels that match their customer's sense of style and identity. That's why every Forgeline wheel is customizable. This DE3C wheel can be customized to fit your specific requests. Sizes, offsets, colors, finishes, and accessories can all be made to your specification. Contact us for further information on a custom Forgeline wheel set for you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required. Because Forgeline wheels are custom manufactured, returns or refunds are not available.

This set of staggered D-Force LTW5 wheels for the E46 M3 uses a very aggressive 9.0"" front wheel and a standard sized 9.5"" rear wheel. There is a lot of room in the front to run a bigger wheel and the 9.0 fits nicely without being too wide. And with the wider front wheel you can use a meatier front tire for more grip without having to jump all the way up to a square race setup. Here are the critical wheel specs:   Front:    / ET 41 / 18lbs. This aggressive offset will push the wheel out by 19mm (.75"") compared to the factory 8.0"" wheel. That's like putting a 20mm spacer on your stock wheel but also gaining a full inch of wheel width. We recommend a 255-265 tire size on this wheel.  Rear:    / ET 25 with a 10mm spacer / 18.5lbs. This is the stock width because the M3 9.5 is already very wide for this car. We recommend a 265-275mm width tire. The LTW5 wheel comes as a 35mm offset and we add a 10mm spacer to bring it back to the correct, factory position. Longer black wheel bolts are included with this package. With the 10mm spacers, minor trimming of the car's hub lip may be required for a flush fit.   These new wheels are among the strongest and lightest we have ever offered. And they are excellent quality with years of proven satisfaction from street warriors to track junkies alike. These wheels are cast using a new flow-forming method that keeps the weight low and strength high compared with traditional cast wheels. This process results in a 'semi-forged' wheel at a fraction of the cost of a fully forged wheel.

It's no wonder that you'll find so many cars at track events with LTW5 wheels. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.These D-Force wheels use the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

The HRE FlowForm wheel line offers forged wheel strength and HRE's stimulating designs at a more attractive price. HRE FF01 FlowForm wheels are a Y-spoke design instantly familiar and at-home on BMWs. The FF01 closely resembles the famous CSL or ZCP factory designs but with distinct details and more desirable sizes and offsets. FF01 wheels are available in 19"" and 20"" sizes that fit with the proper offset (no spacers required). Concave centers emphasize the muscular and athletic stance while two standard and eleven optional finishes trigger the visual impact. The FlowForm process is new technology with the attributes of a fully forged wheel but at a lower cost. FlowForm starts as a cast face and the barrel is then spin formed over a mold at intense pressure. This gives the wheel greater strength but lighter in weight and with more precise tolerances than a traditional cast wheel. HRE FF wheels are TUV, VIA, and JWL approved and come with a lifetime structural warranty and two-year finish warranty. HRE FlowForm Wheel Features - + state-of-the-art technology + lighter and stronger than a cast wheel + stimulating looks + multiple color and finish options encourage personalization + lifetime structural warranty + TUV, VIA, and JWL approved",Call us at  if you are interested in custom color options!,1.800.280.6966,,,,,,,,

They are a direct fit to most any 1-series (E82), 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. This is an excellent wheel for SpecE46 (SE46). The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels. Adding larger wheels may lead to rubbing on suspension components or bodywork. Wheel spacers, new alignment settings, inside fender modifications, or other adjustments may be required.

It's no wonder that you'll find so many cars at track events with LTW5 wheels. Through advanced engineering and manufacturing methods D Force has created a lightweight wheel that can also withstand the stresses and rigors of a racetrack. D-Force were pioneers in the flow-forming casting technology that results in wheel stronger and lighter than other cast wheels. LTW5 wheels are typically over 10lbs lighter than a factory BMW wheel! With less weight the car is able to accelerate faster, the brakes are more responsive, and the suspension can react quicker which is especially helpful in transitions and autocross. The LTW5 style uses a classic 5-spoke design with clean simple good looks and generous sizing for big brakes. They're also easy to clean! Multiple color and profile options allow you to set just the right look and stance for your car. As well as being pleasing to the eye these are very strong and functional wheels that are at home on the street as well as the racetrack.   These D-Force wheels use the BMW standard 5/120 bolt pattern and with a 72.6mm center bore. They are a direct fit to most any 3-series (E36, E46, E90, E92, F30), Z3, and Z4-series BMWs. The original BMW center cap, TPMS sensors, and original lug bolts are all carried over from your original wheels (wheel bolts may vary if spacers are used). They come in a wide variety of diameter, width, and offset combinations which gives you multiple fitment and application opportunities. For street use we generally recommend a staggered setup with a rear wheel slightly wider than the front. For track and racing applications a square setup is desired with the same width in the front and rear. Wheel offsets may also vary based on the clearances and stance you wish to achieve. Refer to our image gallery for inspiration. If you'd like more input give us a call or e-mail and we'd be happy to go over the many options with you.   Note: careful consideration of wheel width, offset and tire sizing must be observed when choosing and installing larger wheels.
