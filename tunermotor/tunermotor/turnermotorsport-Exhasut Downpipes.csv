BMW's solution to deal with the limited space in the engine compartment is to crush the turbo outlet tubes to reduce the size of the tubing. Doing this created undesirable backpressure. For emission purposes the factory also incorporated built-in pre-cats directly after the turbo outlet ports. This make the exhaust gas backpressure rise to extremely high levels at all rpm and engine loads. This design retains excessive heat in the engine and affects performance in a negative way. The design of the Supersprint down pipes takes advantage of even the smallest space available and frees the exhaust gas flow dramatically. The SS pipe cross section (no crushed pipe) remains constant all along the down pipes and the pre-cats are totally eliminated.

The Active Autowerke N55 downpipe for the M235i, 335i, 435i and M2 helps unleash some of the potential that is restricted by the OEM downpipe. Turbochargers are powered by spent exhaust gases created during the combustion process. The quicker these gases are evacuated, the better. Unfortunately, the factory down pipe in the N55 is quite restrictive, which results in slower exhaust gases and slower turbo spool. The Active Autowerke F-Chassis N55 Signature down pipe utilizes 3.5” diameter stainless steel piping in order to provide more power, quicker spool, and extreme durability. This variant includes a 4.5"" high flow GESI catalytic converter that will NOT produce a CEL! The GESi® G-Sport Ultra High Output Catalytic Converter features full 304 stainless steel construction, including the substrate. GESi® UHO-Series Catalytic Converters are EPA certified in 49 states and fully OBD2 compliant. GESi® proprietary precious metal loading technology ensures greatly reduced emissions, eliminating most ""Check Engine Lights"". These high flow catalytic converters outperform stock converters and provide a reliable solution to the most common catalytic converter problems. The GESi® UHO-Series Catalytic Converters are rated for engines putting out between 500 and 850 horsepower while maintaining a high flow capacity. The reduced back-pressure from this high flow catalytic converter will allow you to maximize your engines horsepower without the harmful emissions. Say goodbye to Check Engine Lights and failed emissions tests! Please Note: These catalytic converters are not legal for use on vehicles registered in the state of California as a result of California Vehicle Code Section 27156 and 38391."

The Active Autowerke Signature downpipes are designed with the intent to maximize power. These downpipes are created with the least amount of restrictions possible by utilizing a full 3"" piping throughout with the least amount of bends possible. What you will experience is a faster, more responsive engine because the turbo impeller now has the ability to spool that much faster. The end result is more power.

By removing the factory catalytic converter, most of this restriction is removed gaining advantages in more than just peak horsepower. The factory downpipe, while excellent for maintaining strict emission regulations, does nothing to unlock the performance of a turbocharged engine. Due to an internal honeycomb structure that the exhaust gasses must pass through, flow is massively reduced. Additionally, this honeycomb causes turbulence after the converter which slows exhaust flow even further and causes more restriction. If you've ever tried to blow through a coffee straw, you know how your car feels. This not only limits how fast the turbo can spool or come up to speed but also how much air it can move in general. When the internal honeycomb structure is removed in favor of a straight and hollow piece, these issues are alleviated. Not only can the turbocharger come up to max rpm faster, is does this more efficiently and with less work since there is no back-pressure against the turbine wheel. Turbo lag becomes a thing of the past and because of this, the powerband shifts and massive top-end gains can be felt. Constructed out of 100% 304-grade stainless steel and fully mandrel bent, you can be sure that as much time has been put into construction as development. They are 100% TIG welded by in-house fabricators and built in the USA. The factory turbocharger turbine housing utilizes a V-Band flange which Evolution have duplicated and CNC machined cut out of billet 304 stainless steel. Stainless Steel CNC machined O2 sensor and laser cut brackets are TIG welded using stainless steel rods and the O2 sensor is positioned at the factory location."

This restriction slows turbocharger spool and reduces efficiency, and has a significant impact on power. When modifying their N20, most enthusiasts quickly find OEM downpipes offer insufficient performance as power levels are increased, resulting in disappointing results from other modifications. While some find catless downpipes to be the answer, their benefits are increasingly failing to outweigh the downsides when used on the street. Exhaust volume is increased (combined with a full exhaust may be too much for sensitive ears), check engine lights are frequently illuminated, and emissions are greatly increased (a problem for the environment and in passing emissions testing). Turner engineers designed downpipes that met a happy compromise - excellent flow with high performance 48-state legal catalytic converters. By utilizing cats, these downpipes offer much lower emissions than catless products (and in many cases, no check engine light), with little sacrifice to performance versus their catless counterparts.
