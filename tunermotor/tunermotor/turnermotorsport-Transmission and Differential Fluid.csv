Red Line MT-LV is a premium middle-weight GL-4 oil that bridges the gap between ATF D4 and standard MTL fluid. In hot climates or track scenarios where ATF D4 can be too thin and in cold climates where MTL can be too thick, this in-between oil is the ideal viscosity to ensure your transmission continues to operate perfectly. Features and benefits: Offers quicker shifts, a perfect synchronizer coefficient of friction Safe for brass synchros, as it lacks the reactive sulfurs found in most GL-5 oils that cause damage High-performance gear protection and longer synchro life Eliminates notchy shifting, even when cold Low fluid friction to improve power transfer Satisfies the gear oil viscosity requirements of 70W & 75W Recommended for GL-1, GL-3 and GL-4 applications as well as where most special synchromesh fluids are specified Suitable replacement for BMW MTF LT-2, MTF LT-3, 83220397244, DTF-1"
