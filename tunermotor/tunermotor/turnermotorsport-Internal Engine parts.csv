The original BMW bearings have too little clearance, which leads to premature bearing wear and can cause early engine failure. Furthermore, the factory BMW bearings are made from tin-aluminum which are 5-times harder than a softer lead-copper bearing design. A softer bearing is better for your engine and more tolerant of foreign particles suspended in your oil."

Schrick coats the contact pad with a DLC coating for reduced friction and improved reliability. The stock S54 rocker arm is un-coated. With more aggressive camshafts there is much higher force and friction on the contact pad which will not only induce more wear on the rocker arm but also lead to higher temperatures and thinning of the oil in a critical spot. The Schrick rocker is preferred over the stock part with any of the more aggressive S54 cams (304/296 or high lift, etc). The DLC coating is extremely hard (DLC = Diamond-Like Coating) but with a graphite content that allows for low friction levels. The DLC coating resists oils and chemicals so it's perfect for an internal part like a cam follower.   New rocker arms are required with any new camshaft installation. Sold per rocker arm.     2001-2006    M3  2001-2002    Z3 M Roadster M Coupe  2003-2008    Z4 M Roadster M Coupe"

We found that the stock original valve springs can be too weak when used with upgraded cams and this genuine BMW Motorsport part is an upgrade over the original design. Valve springs also get weaker over time so these are the perfect replacement when refreshing the S14 cylinder head. A weak spring can lead to a burnt valve seat or even a bent valve. These are also the stock springs in the M88/S38 and Euro S50B30.

They're actually designed to be the weak link to prevent more extensive damage elsewhere in the valvetrain. The rocker arm actuates the valves as the cam lobe makes contact. But sustained running at high RPM will cause the valves to 'float' or stay open which can lead to contact between the piston and the valves. If this happens too often, it will fatigue and snap the rocker arm. Therefore, any track driven E30 should have the rockers inspected or replaced often, along with a correct valve adjustment. And any high mileage M20 engine is running the risk of failure because of fatigue and weak valve springs. It's also a good idea to use new rocker arms any time a new cam is installed as the cam and the rocker wear together.   Replacement of the rocker arms can be done with the cylinder head in the car but more often, the head is removed. This makes removing the rocker shafts easier. Either way, a new cylinder head gasket set is recommended as it includes all of the gaskets and plugs that you would need. If the head stays on the car, the radiator may need to be removed to allow more access for the shafts to come out. Replacing the engine timing belt is not done at the same time and should be treated as a separate job.   These Febi M20 rocker arms are sold per rocker (order 12 for a complete set). You may also want to replace the eccentric adjusters as it's easy to do and worn eccentrics may prevent you from properly adjusting the valves afterward.     1984-1991    325e 325es 325i 325ic 325is 325ix   1989-1990    525i"

This package is the most complete rod bearing overhaul kit available and includes not just the latest BMW rod bearings and connecting rod bolts, but also everything else that should be replaced with the oil pan and front subframe off the car.Rod bearings continue to be a sore subject among M3, M5, and M6 owners. The rod bearings in the S85 V10 have been known to fail within 60,000 miles. There could be a number of reasons for premature failure with a lot of finger-pointing as to the real cause. Whatever the reason, rod bearings are wearing out sooner than expected and their replacement should be considered a required preventative maintenance item. We suggest a replacement interval of between 60,000-80,000 miles with frequent engine oil analysis done along the way*. Driving moderately and allowing the engine to warm up before hard use will also extend rod bearing life.After doing so many rod bearing replacements in our own service shop we have put together this comprehensive overhaul package. Our package includes -Genuine BMW rod bearings- 11247841703, upper bearings - latest design from BMW (either original or WPC treated**)- 11247841702, upper bearings - latest design from BMW (either original or WPC treated**)- 11247834522, connecting rod bolts- Red Line engine assembly lubeOil Pan- 11137836361, oil pan gasket- 07119905485, oil pan screws (required by BMW)- 07129905600, oil pan screws (required by BMW)- 11137836568, oil pan screws- 07119963129, seal washers- 11417836233, auxiliary oil pump gaskets- 11121304174, oil pickup tube o-ringReplacing the rod bearings requires mechanical knowledge and skill, a clean workspace, and several specialist tools. Our preferred procedure is to leave the engine in the car but remove the front subframe. The engine must be supported from above with an engine brace. Removing the front subframe involves disconnecting the control arms and steering rack and steering column. The oil pan can then be removed and you can access the connecting rods and bearings. Replacing the rod bearings themselves is straightforward but patience and forethought will be extremely helpful. In addition to analyzing the severity of the rod bearing wear, the crankshaft must also be inspected closely for damage. Rod bearings that have been severely worn may have damaged the crankshaft (requiring replacement or machining).* BMW released an updated rod bearing around 2011 that uses different materials than the original design. The old rod bearings were constructed with several layers or metal, including copper and lead. If an engine oil analysis revealed high levels of these specific metals then it was a sure sign that the rod bearings were nearing replacement. However, the new BMW bearings do not use copper or lead so an oil analysis will not alert you to heavy bearing wear. The new bearings are also a harder material which prolonged the life of the bearing but increased the liklihood of crankshaft damage if a bearing failed. Even though the bearing theoretically lasts longer it's even more important to preventativly replace them before they damage the crankshaft."

The new bolts installed in these earlier engines are M10 size. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing which rod or bolt is currently in your car (unless your car came with service records detailing when and what was replaced).

ARP studs are threaded after heat-treat, which gives them 1000% (that's ten times!) better fatigue strength than studs threaded prior to heat-treat. Threading the studs after heat-treating is more difficult and costly (as it's harder on tooling) but the results are well worth the effort. These simply are the best head studs we've found and we highly recommend them in both racing and forced induction applications. Due to the additional clamping force between the head and block, these are IDEAL for turbocharged engines. Converting from the factory BMW head bolts to head studs makes it much easier to assemble an engine, especially a racing powerplant which must be serviced frequently (and quickly!), and also ensures proper alignment of the head and gasket. Head studs also provide more accurate and consistent torque loading. Here's why: When you use bolts to secure the head, the fastener is actually being ""twisted"" while it's being torqued to the proper reading. Accordingly, the bolt is reacting to two different forces simultaneously. A head stud should be installed in a ""relaxed"" mode -- never crank it in tightly using a jammed nut. If everything is right, the stud should be installed finger tight. Then, when applying torque to the nut, the stud will stretch only on the vertical axis. An information sheet is provided with each set."

These effectively limit your revs to 7200-7300 RPM as the valves 'float' at higher revs, leading to piston-valve contact. By converting to a machined solid lifter, and upgrading other areas of the engine, you can configure the valve train to withstand high RPM running. Not only can you tune for more power, you can help prevent damage during a mild mechanical over-rev.   This kit includes the mechanical spacers to convert hydraulic lifter tappets to solid lifters. The lifter bucket remains in place with the Schrick solid tappet replacing the original. These work on all M50, M52, S50, S52 and M54 engines and were proven in normally aspirated as well as supercharged engines. A custom camshaft is required.   Professional installation and setup is mandatory as these require complete assembly of the head, checking valve lash, then dis-assembly and machining of the Schrick tappet to spec.

ARP uses a premium grade 8740 alloy that is rated far superior to ""aircraft"" quality. Each stud is heat-treated to 200,000 psi, ensuring complete heat penetration. ARP studs are threaded after heat-treat, which gives them 1000% (that's ten times!) better fatigue strength than studs threaded prior to heat-treat. Threading the studs after heat-treating is more difficult and costly (as it's harder on tooling) but the results are well worth the effort. These simply are the best S54 head studs we've found for the E46 M3 6 cylinder engines, and we highly recommend them in both the racing and forced induction arena. (Due to the additional clamping force between the head and block, these are IDEAL for turbo charging and supercharging!)   Converting from the factory BMW head bolts to head studs makes it much easier to assemble an engine, especially a racing powerplant which must be serviced frequently (and quickly!), and also ensures proper alignment of the head and gasket. Head studs also provide more accurate and consistent torque loading. Here's why: When you use bolts to secure the head, the fastener is actually being ""twisted"" while it's being torqued to the proper reading. Accordingly, the bolt is reacting to two different forces simultaneously. A head stud should be installed in a ""relaxed"" mode -- never crank it in tightly using a jammed nut. If everything is right, the stud should be installed finger tight. Then, when applying torque to the nut, the stud will stretch only on the vertical axis. An information sheet is provided with each set. Kit includes everything pictured -- 14 head bolts, washers, bolts and assembly lubricant.   ARP is a company that prides itself on performance and durability, no matter the application. Offering the finest engine hardware money can buy is the driving initiative at ARP and this is evidenced by the staggering amount of satisfied customers and race teams the world over.​     2001-2006    coupe & convertible  2001-2002    M Roadster & M Coupe (with S54 engine)  2006-2008    Z4 M Roadster & M Coupe"

Head studs also provide more accurate and consistent torque loading. Here's why: When you use bolts to secure the head, the fastener is actually being ""twisted"" while it's being torqued to the proper reading. Accordingly, the bolt is reacting to two different forces simultaneously. A head stud should be installed in a ""relaxed"" mode -- never crank it in tightly using a jammed nut.

One item that is always found to be a weak point- the OEM hardware. It is definitely sub-par for real performance use under high stress such as modded engines and track use. We use these fasteners on all of VAC's in-house head builds. Whenever the head is coming off, your switching to forced induction, or if you are simply prepping to drive your car hard; we highly recommend switching to far superior race-grade hardware. These Head Stud Kits greatly improve reliability; helping to eliminate movement of the of the cylinder head and intern, gasket failure caused by inferior OEM head-bolt stretch. This is the #1 cause of premature head gasket failure, especially on boosted or high output engines. Though more expensive than OEM, converting to one of VAC's head studs kits will not only give added strength and reliability when its needed most, but provides the most accurate torque readings because studs don’t “twist” into the block; all clamping forces are on one axis, and there is less force exerted on the normally stressed threads of the block. This increases block and hardware life and typically makes the head easier to properly install to the block, a blessing if your head may have to be removed more than once. Especially in the time crunch of racing, when engines are dissembled frequently, studs make removing and installing the cylinder head on to the block a much easier task. By allowing the studs to act as a guide on to the head, your head slides on and off and also ensures proper alignment of the head and gasket for the same reason. It is similar to converting your wheel-bolts to wheel-studs."

ARP uses a premium grade 8740 alloy that is rated far superior to ""aircraft"" quality. Each stud is heat-treated to 200,000 psi, ensuring complete heat penetration. ARP studs are threaded after heat-treat, which gives them 1000% (that's ten times!) better fatigue strength than studs threaded prior to heat-treat. Threading the studs after heat-treating is more difficult and costly (as it's harder on tooling) but the results are well worth the effort. These simply are the best head studs we've found and we highly recommend them in both racing and forced induction applications. Due to the additional clamping force between the head and block, these are IDEAL for turbocharged engines.   Converting from the factory BMW/MINI head bolts to head studs makes it much easier to assemble an engine, especially a racing powerplant which must be serviced frequently (and quickly!), and also ensures proper alignment of the head and gasket. Head studs also provide more accurate and consistent torque loading. Here's why: When you use bolts to secure the head, the fastener is actually being ""twisted"" while it's being torqued to the proper reading. Accordingly, the bolt is reacting to two different forces simultaneously. A head stud should be installed in a ""relaxed"" mode -- never crank it in tightly using a jammed nut. If everything is right, the stud should be installed finger tight. Then, when applying torque to the nut, the stud will stretch only on the vertical axis. An information sheet is provided with each set.   ARP is a company that prides itself on performance and durability, no matter the application. Offering the finest engine hardware money can buy is the driving initiative at ARP and this is evidenced by the staggering amount of satisfied customers and race teams the world over.     2002-2006    MINI Cooper  2002-2006    MINI Cooper S"

This is the set of rod bearings for the S85 V10 in the E60 M5 and E63 M6 (BMW part numbers 11247841703 and 11247841702). This is just the set of bearings and does not include any of the other items that need to be replaced at the same time (connecting rod bolts, oil pan gasket, hardware, etc).     Rod bearings continue to be a sore subject among M3, M5, and M6 owners. The rod bearings in the S85 V8 have been known to fail within 60,000 miles. There could be a number of reasons for premature failure with a lot of finger-pointing as to the real cause. Whatever the reason, rod bearings are wearing out sooner than expected and their replacement should be considered a required preventative maintenance item. We suggest a replacement interval of between 60,000-80,000 miles with frequent engine oil analysis done along the way*. Driving moderately and allowing the engine to warm up before hard use will also extend rod bearing life.   * BMW released an updated rod bearing around 2011 that uses different materials than the original design. The old rod bearings were constructed with several layers or metal, including copper and lead. If an engine oil analysis revealed high levels of these specific metals then it was a sure sign that the rod bearings were nearing replacement. However, the new BMW bearings do not use copper or lead so an oil analysis will not alert you to heavy bearing wear. The new bearings are also a harder material which prolonged the life of the bearing but increased the liklihood of crankshaft damage if a bearing failed. Even though the bearing theoretically lasts longer it's even more important to preventativly replace them before they damage the crankshaft.     2006-2010    M5  2006-2011    M6"

Supertech seals offer a significantly longer life span and are resistant to both heat and chemicals thanks to their use of Viton or Polyacrylic construction (dependant on valve type).

Supertech valve stem seals are the way to go! This cheap but effective seal replaces the stock BMW seals that are notoriously prone to issues due to heat cycles and chemicals which cause the seals to become weak and brittle. Supertech seals offer a significantly longer life span and are resistant to both heat and chemicals thanks to their use of Viton or Polyacrylic construction (dependant on valve type). That means less time in the garage and more time on the street or track! These seals are also great for anyone who is looking to upgrade to dual valve springs thanks to the seal's overall thinner outer diameter! Guide OD: 8.8mm/.347"" Seal OD: 12.2mm/.480"""

Supertech valve stem seals are the way to go! This cheap but effective seal replaces the stock BMW seals that are notoriously prone to issues due to heat cycles and chemicals which cause the seals to become weak and brittle. Supertech seals offer a significantly longer life span and are resistant to both heat and chemicals thanks to their use of Viton or Polyacrylic construction (dependant on valve type). That means less time in the garage and more time on the street or track! These seals are also great for anyone who is looking to upgrade to dual valve springs thanks to the seal's overall thinner outer diameter! Guide OD: 8.8mm/.347"" Seal OD: 12.2mm/.480"""

ARP uses a premium grade 8740 alloy that is rated far superior to ""aircraft"" quality. Each stud is heat-treated, ensuring complete heat penetration, to increase the clamping load up to 200,000 psi. ARP studs are threaded after heat-treat, which gives them 1000% (that's ten times!) better fatigue strength than studs threaded prior to heat-treat. Threading the studs after heat-treating is more difficult and costly (as it's harder on tooling) but the results are well worth the effort. These simply are the best head studs we've found and we highly recommend them in both racing and forced induction applications. Due to the additional clamping force between the head and block, these are IDEAL for turbocharged engines.    Converting from the factory BMW head bolts to head studs makes it much easier to assemble an engine, especially a racing powerplant which must be serviced frequently (and quickly!), and also ensures proper alignment of the head and gasket. Head studs also provide more accurate and consistent torque loading. Here's why: When you use bolts to secure the head, the fastener is actually being ""twisted"" while it's being torqued to the proper reading. Accordingly, the bolt is reacting to two different forces simultaneously. A head stud should be installed in a ""relaxed"" mode -- never crank it in tightly using a jammed nut. If everything is right, the stud should be installed finger tight. Then, when applying torque to the nut, the stud will stretch only on the vertical axis. An information sheet is provided with each set.      M30 3.0L 3.4L I6"

Each main stud is made using the best materials, process, design and engineering, which exceeds even the most stringent racing and aerospace specifications. This main stud kit includes hardened parallel-ground washers and aerospace quality nuts.   The studs are manufactured from 8740 chrome moly steel, heat-treated in-house to 190,000 psi tensile strength, and precision J-form threads rolled after heat-treat to create a fastener that has threads 1000% stronger than others. On the MINI, there's no reason to settle for anything less than the best, which is why we carry and use ARP fasteners and studs on our own BMW race cars.   ARP is a company that prides itself on performance and durability, no matter the application. Offering the finest engine hardware money can buy is the driving initiative at ARP and this is evidenced by the staggering amount of satisfied customers and race teams the world over."

ARP uses a premium grade 8740 alloy that is rated far superior to ""aircraft"" quality. Each stud is heat-treated to 200,000 psi, ensuring complete heat penetration. ARP studs are threaded after heat-treat, which gives them 1000% (that's ten times!) better fatigue strength than studs threaded prior to heat-treat. Threading the studs after heat-treating is more difficult and costly (as it's harder on tooling) but the results are well worth the effort. These simply are the best head studs we've found and we highly recommend them in both racing and forced induction applications. Due to the additional clamping force between the head and block, these are IDEAL for turbocharged engines.   Converting from the factory BMW head bolts to head studs makes it much easier to assemble an engine, especially a racing powerplant which must be serviced frequently (and quickly!), and also ensures proper alignment of the head and gasket. Head studs also provide more accurate and consistent torque loading. Here's why: When you use bolts to secure the head, the fastener is actually being ""twisted"" while it's being torqued to the proper reading. Accordingly, the bolt is reacting to two different forces simultaneously. A head stud should be installed in a ""relaxed"" mode -- never crank it in tightly using a jammed nut. If everything is right, the stud should be installed finger tight. Then, when applying torque to the nut, the stud will stretch only on the vertical axis. An information sheet is provided with each set.     1970-1976    1600 2002 2002tii  1977-1983    320i   1984-1985    318i"
