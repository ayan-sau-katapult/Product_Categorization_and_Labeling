And because it's a Bavarian Autosport product, it comes with a 2-year warranty (vs. 1-year on others). Plus they're custom-cut to fit your year and model BMW precisely -- no trimming required. From 1974 to 2019, Bavarian Autosport was one of the premier vendors for BMW and MINI auto parts. We are happy to preserve the Bav Auto legacy by continuing to carry their high-quality products into the future. All Bav Auto parts will remain unchanged in design and sourced from the same OEM suppliers to ensure long-lasting reliability.
