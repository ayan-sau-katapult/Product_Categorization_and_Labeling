       ...",362357,001170SCH01A,$29.95,"Replacing the fan clutch on most BMW models requires holding the water pump pulley while removing the fan clutch lock nut.

The coolant refill tool solves this problem, ensuring that you get an air pocket free fill. The entire task is as simple as draining the system like normal, reinstalling the drain plugs and hooking the tool up to your refill location. The reason this tool works so well is due to the venturi valve, it converts air pressure from the compressor to vacuum inside the cooling system, then with a twist of a valve sucks coolant right into the system using the vacuum pressure."
