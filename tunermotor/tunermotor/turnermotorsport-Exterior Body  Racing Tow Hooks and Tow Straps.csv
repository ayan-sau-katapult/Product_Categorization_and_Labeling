We use a heavy-duty, chemical-resistant polyester strap webbed around a stainless steel stud. There is plenty of length available for tow hooks to grab onto without hitting your bumper and damaging paint or causing cracks. The precision-cut stud is fits E30 (89+), E36, E46, E82, E90, E92, Z3, and Z4. We have further refined the shape and size of the bolt so that spoiler modifications are kept to a minimum. Note that on some models you may need to modify the bumper slightly for the best fit.   A tow strap is a better pickup point than a fixed steel ring, which will add weight and protrude past the bumper. Some racing series have banned the steel rings because they increase the likelihood of contact during close racing. Our straps are sold in bright red, bright blue, or black (red suggested for racing use as it makes it easy for tow truck operators and safety crews to spot). On some models, the strap may be tucked behind the bumper panel when not on track, which makes this perfect for dual-use track/street cars and full racecars alike. Priced per strap so order two for the front and rear.     1989-1991    318i 318is 325i 325is  2008-2012    128i 135i 1M Coupe  1992-1999    318i 318is 318ti 318ic 323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3  1999-2006    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi M3  2006-2011    325i 325xi 328i 328xi 328i xDrive 330i 330xi 335d 335i 335xi 335i xDrive M3 - Sedan  2006-2012    325xi 328i 328xi 328i xDrive - Wagon  2007-2013    328i 328xi 328i xDrive 335i 335is 335xi 335i xDrive M3 - Coupe  1997-2002    Z3 1.9 Z3 2.3 Z3 2.5i Z3 2.8 Z3 3.0i M Roadster M Coupe  2003-2008    Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si Z4 M Roadster M Coupe  2009+    Z4 sDrive28i Z4 sDrive30i Z4 sDrive35i Z4 sDrive35is"
