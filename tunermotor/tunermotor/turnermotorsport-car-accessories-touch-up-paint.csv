How can I obtain the best results with my Paint Pen? A. Always start with a clean car. Paint will not stick to dirt or wax. If you are washing your car yourself, use a natural sponge or chamois for best results. Make sure the car is dry. Q. Why does paint sometimes flow out of the sides of the Paint Pen when I depress the tip? A. This happens if you press the tip too hard on a surface. Remove excess from the side with a paper towel. Q. Does the temperature make a difference when I touch up my car? A. Yes. Never touch up your car in the direct sunlight. The ideal temperatures are between 65-80 degrees. Q. What if I don't like what I've just done? A. Place a small amount of paint thinner on a cotton swab. Gently wipe it over the area you just touched up. You can shine up any dulled areas later on with wax. Q. How do I get a high gloss finish? A. Make sure every coat is dry prior to applying another coat of paint. For an even higher gloss, you may purchase our clear coat pens from us. Q. How should I store my Paint Pen? A. Store the pen on its side and keep it in a cool, dry place. Never keep it in your car."

How can I obtain the best results with my Paint Pen? A. Always start with a clean car. Paint will not stick to dirt or wax. If you are washing your car yourself, use a natural sponge or chamois for best results. Make sure the car is dry. Q. Why does paint sometimes flow out of the sides of the Paint Pen when I depress the tip? A. This happens if you press the tip too hard on a surface. Remove excess from the side with a paper towel. Q. Does the temperature make a difference when I touch up my car? A. Yes. Never touch up your car in the direct sunlight. The ideal temperatures are between 65-80 degrees. Q. What if I don't like what I've just done? A. Place a small amount of paint thinner on a cotton swab. Gently wipe it over the area you just touched up. You can shine up any dulled areas later on with wax. Q. How do I get a high gloss finish? A. Make sure every coat is dry prior to applying another coat of paint. For an even higher gloss, you may purchase our clear coat pens from us. Q. How should I store my Paint Pen? A. Store the pen on its side and keep it in a cool, dry place. Never keep it in your car."
