These radiators are a direct replacement to the factory unit making it an effortless install and provides up to a 30% more cooling capacity. Made from aircraft quality aluminum, these radiators have a dual row core and polished end tanks. So what are the advantages of an aluminum radiator? Well, first is the lightweight aspect of the radiator. You can run a larger radiator at the same weight as a stock unit. Also, in case of leaks years down the road, an aluminum radiator can be welded and repaired, saving costly replacement in the future. It is also much more durable, channeling heat better and resisting cracking and breaking, even at high temperatures."

So the cooling of the charged air is not realized by the ambient air as cooling medium (as usual), but made with its own cooling water circuit. A reduction of the temperature of the cooling water is directly equated with an improved cooling performance of the charged air. This is exactly where the advantages of the WAGNERTUNING upgrade water cooler comes into play. The new developed competition racing cores of the WAGNERTUNING high performance water coolers increase the radiator volume of the OEM water coolers by 89% for front mounted and 94% for side mounted. The calculated ratio between the inner and outer cooling surface generates a maximum heat transfer and allows at the same time enough air flow for the surrounding components (for example the engine water cooler) for its own heat exchange.

This kit replaces both the stock front radiator and both auxiliary radiators with Mishimoto's high-performance all-aluminum versions for a massive spike in cooling performance and overall reliability. Key Features: All aluminum construction More durable and longer-lasting than plastic components 30% more capacity in the same radiator locations 180% Increase to external fin surface area Excellent fit and finish Unbeatable lifetime warranty and accident-forgiveness Mishimoto radiators address all of the defects and deficiencies of the stock Supra radiator in a well-engineered and price-competitive direct replacement unit. The Mishimoto radiator is an all-aluminum design that replaces the factory plastic and aluminum stock radiator. BMW style plastic end tanks are notorious for cracking and leaks, whereas the Mishimoto has aluminum end tanks that will never fail. Mishimoto also allows for a 31% increase in coolant capacity into the main front radiator and a 30% capacity increase for the auxiliary radiators which both fit in the original locations with no modifications. More coolant volume means the fluid is not heat soaked for as long (less superheated fluid circulating through the engine). Mishimoto was established in 2003 as a supplier of cooling components for drift and rally cars. Their radiators and intercoolers soon found a strong following in the hyper-competitive drift scene where high horsepower and prolonged high revs dictate the need for durable and robust cooling solutions. The catchy Mishimoto name is a combination of the name of the founder's family pet - Mishi - and ""moto"". All products are designed and tested in the USA using state-of-the-art CAD tools and prototyping and with the continuous evolution of product design. Mishimoto is so dedicated to quality that they offer a limited lifetime warranty and accident forgiveness."

The features that made FLUIDYNE a leader in the E36 radiator market continue but with some new elements requested by the Turner Motorsport R&D staff. We have made the radiator easier to fit with the stock fan shroud and hanger mounts. The shroud will be better secured to the radiator than before which saves time and hassle. Our goal was to make this as close to a ""drop-in"" replacement as possible. We also had new hangers installed on the bottom to accommodate the factory E36 Euro oil cooler and our oil cooler hangers. A zinc anode drain plug absorbs static electricity from the coolant which helps prolong the life of temp sensors. There has never been a better E36 radiator upgrade than this! For an E36 track or modded street car there should be no reason to ever go back to a stock plastic radiator or compromise on a cheap aluminum radiator. The latest FLUIDYNE is the best there is.   The stock radiator has an aluminum core but with plastic end-tanks and hose connections that become brittle and can leak or crack. You may not even realize your radiator neck is cracked until it's too late and you're stranded on the side of the freeway or unable to continue with your track day. An all-aluminum design does not suffer the defects of similar plastic construction. FLUIDYNE quality is what sets them apart from every other manufacturer. Their radiators feature a high-tech CAB-brazed core construction instead of epoxy (which can leak). All tanks and brackets are TIG welded by hand in the USA. If you plan on owning your BMW for many years to come, or are using it in a situation where failure is NOT an option such as track or racing, then this should be your only option instead of the failure-prone stock radiators.     1995-1999    including coupe, sedan & convertible  1992-1995    325i & 325is sedan/coupe/convt  1996-1998    328i, 328is & 323is coupe/sedan/convt  1999-1999    328is & 323is"

The joints where the cores meet the end tanks tend to get weak and are the first place to spring a leak. Impacts to the fins themselves can cause holes to form. Corrosion and clogging from the inside can make cooling less than effective and compromise coolant flow. Replace your leaking unit with a factory replacement and get that jug of coolant out of your back seat. This is a factory original style radiator from Nissens and will fit perfectly into the stock location. Cooling will be identical to what your car came with originally.

If you're looking for the most complete and unbeatable radiator solution for your E36, this is the best we have seen. Everyone knows the E36 has an Achilles heal in the cooling system with flimsy radiator necks, plastic materials, unreliable water pumps, and not a lot of capacity for some applications. PWR has addressed some of these issues with the ultimate radiator. The 55mm core is a full 13-17mm thicker than the stock radiator. With minor adjusting during installation, all of the factory shrouds and fans will fit. Having a greater capacity means less saturation time for the cooling fluid which leads to more consistent engine temperatures, reducing wear and tear on other cooling components such as the water pump and thermostat. It's also hugely beneficial when using forced induction where increased underhood temperatures will snowball through the rest of the engine compartment and eventually the cooling system. Don't let your radiator end your race!   Not only is this radiator larger, it's designed with the stresses of motorsports in mind. The cooling vanes use a unique oven brazed bonding technology that will not fatigue and crack like epoxyed construction. We have been more impressed with the fitment and quality of PWR over any other brand currently on the market. Aircraft-grade aluminum is used for the tanks and frame, which are TIG-welded for superior strength. The bottom of this radiator incorporates hangers which can be used to mount the stock Euro oil cooler or the TMS Oil Cooler Kit. We have used this on in-house and customer projects and it is a replacement for the stock E36 radiator, with all of the same hose locations and fittings as the original radiator. It mounts to the car with the original clips on the radiator support and the fan shroud/expansion tank bolts to the radiator (you will need to supply your own hardware as spacing and installing the shroud can be done several different ways). But because this is an extra large version of the stock radiator some manual adjusting and fitment care will be required. Professional installation is not required but may be necessary. Each radiator is pressure-tested during manufacturing. Because of the extra depth required between the radiator and engine, extra care will be needed when installed with forced induction kits, non-stock oil coolers, and lines.   PWR is a world-renowned radiator manufacturer, supplying all forms of motorsport from Formula One (2010 World Champion Sebastian Vettel) to WRC to NASCAR. Our TMS Race Team uses PWR for our cooling needs in the Rolex GT and Continental Sports Car series.     1992-1995 E36    1996-1999 E36    1995-1999 E36    (US model)  1994-1999 E36"

So the cooling of the charged air is not realized by the ambient air as a cooling medium (as usual), but made with its own cooling water circuit. A reduction of the temperature of the cooling water is directly equated with an improved cooling performance of the charged air. This is exactly where the advantages of the WAGNERTUNING upgrade radiator comes into play. The newly developed competition racing core of the WAGNERTUNING high-performance radiator increase the radiator volume of the OEM water cooler by a total of 117 %. The calculated ratio between the inner and outer cooling surface generates a maximum heat transfer and allows at the same time enough airflow for the surrounding components (for example the engine radiator) for its own heat exchange. Furthermore, using an increased amount of cooling water, the entire system thermics can be kept at a lower level over a longer period of time. All WAGNERTUNING radiators are equipped with a heat-conductive anti-corrosion coating to ensure a lasting cooling effect.
