What is often thought to be brake fade or fluid boiling, can actually be the brake lines expanding under pressure. This expansion is even more prominent in aged and weathered rubber hoses. Turner Motorsport Stainless Steel brake lines are engineered and assembled with braided stainless steel mesh and offer superior expansion resistance and reinforcement. The resistance to expansion creates a firmer pedal, and a more direct pedal feel. The signature blue polymer coating provides additional protection from the elements and abrasion, which is common with the constant movement of suspension and braking systems."

Even when brand new, factory rubber brake hoses expand under pressure, requiring increased fluid volume and more pedal travel for the desired stopping force. This expansion is even more prominent in aged and weathered rubber hoses. Turner Motorsport Stainless Steel brake lines are engineered and assembled with braided stainless steel mesh and offer superior expansion resistance and reinforcement. The resistance to expansion creates a firmer pedal, and a more direct pedal feel. The signature blue polymer coating provides additional protection from the elements and abrasion, which is common with the constant movement of suspension and braking systems. When you buy brake lines, you want them to last for years to come. Conventional SS lines will corrode the first time they are exposed to water, regardless of how much you spend. Turner has developed a proprietary zinc-nickel coating finish with nearly twice the salt-spray corrosion resistance of a standard plating. Turner SS brake line also feature new low profile connecting hardware, for a cleaner mounted look. Get the brake lines that will continue to look as good as they feel! All Turner brake lines are engineered to comply with DOT (U.S. Department of Transportation) FMVSS 106 standards.

They are DOT and German TUV approved, feature a resilient coating to protect against wear and chafing, and offer tremendous quality at a phenomenal price. These brake lines are made by renowned brake experts, Stoptech, and are ready for the rigors of daily street driving, driving schools, autocross and race events. Each set includes 4 brake lines - 2 front and 2 rear - as well as pre-installed grommets on the front for ideal fit.    Stoptech▒ Stainless Steel Braided Brake Lines provide a quicker, firmer, more consistent pedal response by maintaining consistent brake pressure. Additionally, stainless steel lines provide precision brake modulation, especially during threshold braking. The improvement in pedal feel is more dramatic on older vehicles where the factory rubber line may have softened and swelled due to age.   StopTech▒ brake lines consist of a PTFE (commonly referred to as Teflon▒) inner line that carries the brake fluid, which is then covered with a layer of stainless steel woven braid. The PTFE tube is very resistant to expansion under pressure and will not degrade from exposure to brake fluid.   The braided stainless steel provides support for the PTFE and the weave is extremely durable against incidental impact and abrasion. Next the stainless braided hose is coated with a clear abrasion resistant PVC cover for maximum protection against chaffing and strain relief devices reinforce end fittings.     2004-2010    525i 530i 528i 535i 545i 550i M5  2004-2010    645ci 650i M6"

If you are already planning on replacing your factory lines due to your vehicle's age, ECS's stainless steel brake lines are a great solution. Factory rubber lines expand under heavy braking, even when new. This causes sloppy pedal feel and overall poor performance. ECS reinforces their exact fit lines with braided stainless steel mesh, creating expansion resistance - this enhances pedal feel and improves performance. Their red polymer coating provides protection from the elements and abrasion that commonly affect brake lines. ECS Exact-Fit stainless lines are manufactured to comply with DOT (U.S. Department of Transportation) FMVSS 106 standards. All lines are made on dedicated, DOT-compliant brake equipment, with every line being tested to 3000 psi prior to shipment."

Even when brand new, factory rubber brake hoses expand under pressure, requiring increased fluid volume and more pedal travel for the desired stopping force. This expansion is even more prominent in aged and weathered rubber hoses. Turner Motorsport Stainless Steel brake lines are engineered and assembled with braided stainless steel mesh and offer superior expansion resistance and reinforcement. The resistance to expansion creates a firmer pedal, and a more direct pedal feel. The signature blue polymer coating provides additional protection from the elements and abrasion, which is common with the constant movement of suspension and braking systems. When you buy brake lines, you want them to last for years to come. Conventional SS lines will corrode the first time they are exposed to water, regardless of how much you spend. Turner has developed a proprietary zinc-nickel coating finish with nearly twice the salt-spray corrosion resistance of a standard plating. Turner SS brake line also feature new low profile connecting hardware, for a cleaner mounted look. Get the brake lines that will continue to look as good as they feel! All Turner brake lines are engineered to comply with DOT (U.S. Department of Transportation) FMVSS 106 standards. All lines are manufactured on dedicated, DOT-compliant brake equipment and each is tested to 3000 psi before being shipped. Turner Motorsport stocks a huge inventory of premium brake components, including pads, rotors, shoes, drums, hoses, hard lines, fluids, hardware, hi-temp lubricants, all the way up to complete brake rebuild kits. Everything you need to perform a professional quality brake service, you can find at Turner Motorsport! Technical features: Fully compliant with DOT Standards (MVSS-1006) Lines burst-tested to 3000psi (maximum tested pressure from a BMW braking system is 1200psi) Zinc-Nickel coating for maximum corrosion resistance Low profile connectors for clean and recessed look"

Brake Line Set - These lines are DOT approved and also feature a clear plastic outside coating. Replace those soft, inferior rubber brake hoses!   Stoptech� Stainless Steel Braided Brake Lines provide a quicker, firmer, more consistent pedal response by maintaining consistent brake pressure. Additionally, stainless steel lines provide precision brake modulation, especially during threshold braking. The improvement in pedal feel is more dramatic on older vehicles where the factory rubber line may have softened and swelled due to age.   StopTech� brake lines consist of a PTFE (commonly referred to as Teflon�) inner line that carries the brake fluid, which is then covered with a layer of stainless steel woven braid. The PTFE tube is very resistant to expansion under pressure and will not degrade from exposure to brake fluid.   The braided stainless steel provides support for the PTFE and the weave is extremely durable against incidental impact and abrasion. Next the stainless braided hose is coated with a clear abrasion resistant PVC cover for maximum protection against chaffing and strain relief devices reinforce end fittings.   These brake lines fit all 2002 to 2007 MINI Cooper and Cooper S. As there was a change to the braking system midway through the 2003 model year, you must select your build date below."
