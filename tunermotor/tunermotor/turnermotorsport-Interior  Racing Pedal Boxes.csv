https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-555656-obp-track-pro-3-pedal-box-bmw-e46-dbw-lhd-no-mc/,OBP Track Pro 3-Pedal Box - E46 3 Series,555656,OBPBLE462,$529.00,"Face it, race cars don't use pedal covers. As good as those Genuine M-Sport covers are, they aren't going to make you faster or make the car respond crisper. For truly unlocking the potential that is Hidden underneath your feet, a proper set of pedals is required. Not only will the positioning be adjustable, it is more hospitable to going fast and needing to go from gas to clutch to brake quickly.  Whats more is that since these pedals are made for racing applications, they can truly take a beating. A day of stomping on the accelerator and standing on the brake is what this OBP set was made for and will not quit after repeated abuse. An internal master cylinder and bias control make adjustment and tuning a breeze, something not possible with a factory setup. New revolutionary floor pan fit incorporating the angle of the floor pan as part of the installation design, means no cutting or welding is needed for installation."
