Our rack stops will help protect your investment. Rack stops are spacers that install inside of the tie rod and limits the amount of steering travel. You can save the costs of replacing rubbing tires, worn out brake ducts, cut shock reservoir hoses, and broken underside plastic panels. There is also the added benefit of knowing you can turn the steering wheel to full lock and not be worried that the wheels will rub. Our rack stop length is the approximate length that will be removed from the outside tire wall�s path. For example, if a 16mm rack stop is used, there will be 16mm more clearance for a brake duct between the fender well and the edge of the tire. Included with this kit: 2 Delrin rack stops, 1 black (driver�s side), 1 white (passenger�s side), 2 Locking plates (only needed on E36), 4 zip ties, detailed instructions."

https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-2364-power-steering-fluid-reservoir-with-filter/,OEM ZF Power Steering Fluid Reservoir with Filter,2364,32411097164,$23.95,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-859-bmw-steering-rack#,This is a replacement power steering fluid reservoir. Why replace the reservoir? Because the connection between the reservoir tank and the hoses is one of the prime locations for power steering leaks on these cars. It's mostly due to the style of clamp that BMW used. But also any replacement clamps are usually over-tightened on these plastic reservoir nipples. There is also a filter inside the reservoir that cannot be changed or serviced. So it's a good idea to replace the tank and get a new filter at the same time. With fresh fluid and a clean filter you might be able to restore some steering smoothness and precision to your BMW! Alternate part number - 32416851217. Reservoir includes new cap with o-ring.     1984-1991    BMW 318i 318is 318ic 325e 325es 325i 325is 325ix 325ic M3   1992-1998    BMW 318i 318is 318ic 318ti 323i 323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3   1999-2005    BMW 323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi M3   1989-1995    BMW 525i 530i 535i 540i   1997-2003    BMW 525i 528i 530i 540i  2004-2010    BMW 525i 525xi 528i 528xi 530i 530xi 545i 550i - not for cars with active steering or dynamic drive  2004+    BMW 645ci 650i - not for cars with active steering or dynamic drive  1989-1994    BMW 735i 740i - not for cars with self leveling suspension  1995-2001    BMW 740i 740il - not for cars with self leveling suspension  2004-2006   BMW X3 2.5i X3 3.0i  2000-2006   BMW X5 3.0i X5 4.4i X5 4.6is X5 4.8is  1997-2001   BMW Z3 1.9 Z3 2.3 Z3 2.5i Z3 2.8 Z3 3.0i M Roadster M Coupe  1997-2001   BMW Zi M Roadster Z4 M Coupe  2000-2003   BMW Z8 Z8 Alpina

You can save the costs of replacing rubbing tires, worn out brake ducts, cut shock reservoir hoses, and broken underside plastic panels. There is also the added benefit of knowing you can turn the steering wheel to full lock and not be worried that the wheels will rub.

Why replace the reservoir? Because the connection between the reservoir tank and the hoses is one of the prime locations for power steering leaks on these cars. It's mostly due to the style of clamp that BMW used. But also any replacement clamps are usually over-tightened on these plastic reservoir nipples. There is also a filter inside the reservoir that cannot be changed or serviced. So it's a good idea to replace the tank and get a new filter at the same time. With fresh fluid and a clean filter you might be able to restore some steering smoothness and precision to your BMW! Alternate part number - 32416851217.
