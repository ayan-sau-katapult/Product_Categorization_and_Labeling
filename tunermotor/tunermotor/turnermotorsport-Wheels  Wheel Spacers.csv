BMW wheels must fit on a hubcentric lip to be securely (and safely) mounted to the hub. But with a 3, 5, 8, or some 10mm spacers on a lip measuring no more than 11mm that presented a huge problem - there would be no lip left over for the wheel to rest on! As one of the world's leading BMW tuners and race teams, we came up with a way to extend the lip and get back the lost surface area for the wheel to safely mount on. Our Hub Extenders are the first of their kind.Hub Extenders fit where the stock dust cap is usually fitted on the front wheel hub. Pop out the dust cap and tap the Hub Extender into its place. It becomes an extension of the original lip. These will only work on the front hubs of the cars listed below because the rear hub is tapered inside (narrows down). These will not work with Xi AWD models because the front axle shaft protrudes through the hub. With Hub Extenders in place you can use nearly any flat wheel spacer - 3mm, 5mm, 7.5mm, 10mm, or possibly more without worrying that the wheel will not be securely seated. This is perfect for wheels that have chamfers on the back of the wheel that don't match up to existing spacers (Kosei K1 spacers for example).",$63.95

Spacers allow you to correct wheel offset issues when the wheel is too 'tucked in' to the bodywork, clear the wheel from contact with the suspension or inner bodywork, clear larger brakes, improve handling and stability by increasing track width, or simply to get the right look and stance. Our wheel spacers are compatible with almost any type of BMW wheel and are a direct fit to the wheel hub (see below for any fitment notes). Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required.   These latest generation of the Turner Motorsport Wheel Spacers represent a total redesign of the wheel spacer concept - a ground-up, clean sheet design based on our years of BMW service and motorsports. We took everything we have learned from our service technicians, customers, and race team crew and built the spacer to beat all spacers. We've been in the BMW wheel spacer business probably longer than anybody and when it came time to make our own spacers, a basic spacer design just wouldn't do.

The ""wheel pad"" is the back of the wheel that mounts to the hub on the car. Since the early 2000s the factory BMW wheel pad diameter has grown - 150mm, 152mm, 154mm, and now 156mm.

Our wheel spacers are compatible with almost any type of BMW wheel and are a direct fit to the wheel hub (see below for any fitment notes). Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required. This latest generation of the Turner Motorsport Wheel Spacers represents a total redesign of the wheel spacer concept - a ground-up, clean-sheet design based on our years of BMW service and motorsports. We took everything we have learned from our service technicians, customers, and race team crew and built the spacer to beat all spacers. We've been in the BMW wheel spacer business probably longer than anybody and when it came time to make our own spacers, a basic spacer design just wouldn't do. We had to make a spacer that is lightweight (for lower unsprung mass), has a tough and durable coating to last through our New England winters, is easily removed (your mechanic will thank you), and is precisely engineered and manufactured for a proper fit on the hub and in the wheel.

That's because BMW chose to use a larger center bore for the E39 wheel than any other BMW model and many wheel manufacturers are reluctant to make E39-specific wheels. These adapters are the correct E39 hub size on the inside and the correct E36/E46/E9X wheel size on the outside with a 20mm thickness. This is good because the E39 needs a low wheel offset and 3-series wheels are all high offset so a spacer would be needed anyway. A Hub Adapter Spacer is the perfect solution! You will need match the spacer to the new wheels (also taking the new wheel width into account) but call us for any fitment questions.

The ""wheel pad"" is the back of the wheel that mounts to the hub on the car. Since the early 2000s the factory BMW wheel pad diameter has grown - 150mm, 152mm, 154mm, and now 156mm. Most of the wheel spacers on the market are 152mm. The difference from using the smaller spacer on a large pad will leave an unsightly step down between the back of the wheel and the brake rotor hat (see image). To fix this visual defect we use a larger diameter spacer - the Big Pad. This will have less of a step, or no step at all, when used with the larger pad size. Note that nearly all aftermarket wheel manufacturers use the smaller pad size (mainly to reduce unsprung weight). For more information on wheel pad sizes and their effects on fitment and strength, click to our spacers FAQ page. Wheel spacers are the ideal solution to resolve a number of fitment and aesthetic problems. A spacer fits between the wheel and the hub assembly. The wheel will be pushed further outboard by the thickness of the spacer. Spacers allow you to correct wheel offset issues when the wheel is too 'tucked in' to the bodywork, clear the wheel from contact with the suspension or inner bodywork, clear larger brakes, improve handling and stability by increasing track width, or simply to get the right look and stance. Our wheel spacers are compatible with almost any type of BMW wheel and are a direct fit to the wheel hub (see below for any fitment notes). Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required. This latest generation of the Turner Motorsport Wheel Spacers represent a total redesign of the wheel spacer concept - a ground-up, clean sheet design based on our years of BMW service and motorsports.

These spacers are the correct 74.0mm center-bore to fit on the hub and 72.5mm center bore on the outside for the wheel to sit on. This spacer will reduce the wheel offset by 15mm. This difference in center bore has left a lot of E39 owners out in the cold when it came to wheel options (especially in the winter). H&R has worked up this easy solution.Note about E36 and E46 wheels � there is a large range in offsets on these wheels. The lowest offset we have seen is 35mm; the highest offset is 49mm. The desired offset for the E39 is 20mm,    H&R makes these wheel adapters in 15mm and 20mm thicknesses. If your E36/E46 wheel is above 43mm in offset, you will run into the problem of the wheel tucked in too far.

Improve handling and stability by increasing track width A spacer fits between the wheel and the hub assembly and pushes the wheel out by the thickness of the spacer. Our wheel spacers are compatible with almost any type of BMW wheel and are a direct fit to the wheel hub (see below for any fitment notes). Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required and included. This latest generation of the Turner Motorsport Wheel Spacers represents a total redesign of the wheel spacer concept - a ground-up, clean-sheet design based on our years of BMW service and motorsports. We took everything we have learned from our service technicians, customers, and race team crew and built the spacer to beat all spacers. We've been in the BMW wheel spacer business probably longer than anybody and when it came time to make our own spacers, a basic spacer design just wouldn't do. We had to make a spacer that is lightweight (for lower unsprung mass), has a tough and durable coating to last through our New England winters, is easily removed (your mechanic will thank you), and is precisely engineered and manufactured for a proper fit on the hub and in the wheel. You won't find a better engineered wheel spacer on the market! Turner Wheel Spacer Features -- hub-centric design, 1-piece spacer precise tolerance fitment thanks to CAD process and CNC mill machine aerospace grade aluminum lightweight but very strong with high resistance to corrosion additional military-spec hard coat for further corrosion resistance innovative Quick Release pockets for easy removal (better than a chamfered back edge) laser-engraved size and part number for easy identification Turner Motorsport track and street tested! Made in the USA Extended Wheel Bolts Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required for all BMW wheel spacers. Spacers cannot be used with stock bolts. Our extended lug bolts are very high quality and high-grade steel lug bolt (grade 10.9).

That's because BMW chose to use a larger center bore for the E39 wheel than any other BMW model and many wheel manufacturers are reluctant to make E39-specific wheels. These adapters are the correct E39 hub size on the inside and the correct E36/E46/E9X wheel size on the outside with a 15mm thickness. This is good because the E39 needs a low wheel offset and 3-series wheels are all high offset so a spacer would be needed anyway. A Hub Adapter Spacer is the perfect solution! You will need match the spacer to the new wheels (also taking the new wheel width into account) but call us for any fitment questions. Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required.These latest generation of the Turner Motorsport Wheel Spacers represent a total redesign of the wheel spacer concept - a ground-up, clean sheet design based on our years of BMW service and motorsports. We took everything we have learned from our service technicians, customers, and race team crew and built the spacer to beat all spacers. We've been in the BMW wheel spacer business probably longer than anybody and when it came time to make our own spacers, a basic spacer design just wouldn't do. We had to make a spacer that is  (for lower unsprung mass), has a tough and  to last through our New England winters, is  (your mechanic will thank you), and is precisely engineered and manufactured for  on the hub and in the wheel.

The depth of the lip must not be greater than the thickness of the spacer. If the hub is deeper than the spacer, the spacer will not seat against the brake rotor and it could lead to spacer and/or wheel failure. Since spacers cannot be returned once opened we strongly advise measuring your lip first. Contact us if you have any questions.

The spacers are drilled for additional lightness and easy fitment. They are then hard anodized for durability. These are not low quality universal spacers - the bolt pattern, hub sizing, and other dimensions are designed to be used on BMW models only.   This spacer slips on the existing hub lip and includes a new lip for the wheel to rest on. 10mm spacers are considered a custom fitment and special consideration must be given to ensure the spacer is fully seated on the lip (and not bottoming out on the stock hub lip).

We've been in the BMW wheel spacer business probably longer than anybody and when it came time to make our own spacers, a basic spacer design just wouldn't do.

That's because BMW chose to use a larger center bore for the E39 wheel than any other BMW model and many wheel manufacturers are reluctant to make E39-specific wheels. These adapters are the correct E39 hub size on the inside and the correct E36/E46/E9X wheel size on the outside with a 17.5mm thickness. This is good because the E39 needs a low wheel offset and 3-series wheels are all high offset so a spacer would be needed anyway. A Hub Adapter Spacer is the perfect solution! You will need to match the spacer to the new wheels (also taking the new wheel width into account) but call us for any fitment questions. Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required.

The spacer is bolted to the hub with special bolts (included). Your wheel bolts to the spacer.  Hubcentric = Yes, this spacer comes with a new hubcentric lip for the wheel to rest on   These special 20mm wheel spacers allow an E39 owner to use E36 or E46 wheels on their car. These spacers are the correct 74.0mm center-bore on the inside and 72.5mm center bore on the outside for the wheel to sit on. This spacer will reduce the wheel offset by 20mm. This difference in center bore has left a lot of E39 owners out in the cold when it came to wheel options (especially in the winter). H&R has worked up this easy solution. This is a DRA spacer system - the spacer bolts to the hub with special bolts; your wheel then bolts to the spacer.Note about E36 and E46 wheels – there is a large range in offsets on these wheels. The lowest offset we have seen is 35mm; the highest offset is 49mm. The desired offset for the E39 is 20mm, depending on wheel width. H&R makes these wheel adapters in 15mm and 20mm thicknesses. If your E36/E46 wheel is above 43mm in offset, you will run into the problem of the wheel tucked in too far. When looking at E36/E46 wheels, try to stay in the 35-43mm offset range.Spacers are sold in pairs (1 axle).   1997-2003    525i 528i 530i 540i M5",

Spacers allow you to correct wheel offset issues, clearance for big brakes or suspension or bodywork, to improve handling and stability by increasing track width, or simply to get the right look and stance. Our spacers are engineered precisely for BMWs, with multiple features that other brands don't have, and have been rigorously tested by our race team and on our street project cars. We have the most advanced BMW wheel spacers on the market because we are BMW specialists and we design, engineer, and manufacture them in-house.   Our in-house R&D dept. solved a shortcoming that is inherent with all small flat spacers -    for the wheel to rest on. BMW designs their wheels to fit on the lip protruding from the hub. The bolts alone are not designed to support the wheel. Placing a flat spacer on the lip reduces the amount of lip available and transfers more stress to the wheel bolts. Since the bolts alone were not designed this way, the bolts and the hub will fail eventually. So our R&D dept. came up with an ingenious combined Spacer and Hub Extender that incorporates a new hub with a flat spacer (a true hubcentric 7.5-8mm spacer). The Turner Interlocking Technology Spacers have a bridged support structure that fits in the voids of the unique M3/M4 hub. This gives an interlocking fitment for the spacer with a new full lip for the wheel to rest on. All other M3/M4 7-8mm spacers are now old news and it would be crazy to run a flat spacer instead of these!   Our spacers are manufactured in-house from an aerospace-grade aluminum, then finished in a military-spec hardcoat that is stronger and more durable than normal anodizing. We finish our spacers in a stealthy grey or black color so they blend in with the wheel and hub. We also use the correct diameter spacer so there is no unsightly step between the wheel and hub. The part number and Turner logo are laser engraved for easy identification. Pockets on the backside of the spacer are a Turner Motorsport innovation and aid in removing a stubborn spacer from the hub.

Spacers allow you to correct wheel offset issues, clearance for big brakes or suspension or bodywork, to improve handling and stability by increasing track width, or simply to get the right look and stance. Our spacers are engineered precisely for BMWs, with multiple features that other brands don't have, and have been rigorously tested by our race team and on our street project cars. We have the most advanced BMW wheel spacers on the market because we are BMW specialists and we design, engineer, and manufacture them in-house.   Our in-house R&D dept. solved a shortcoming that is inherent with all small flat spacers -    for the wheel to rest on. BMW designs their wheels to fit on the lip protruding from the hub. The bolts alone are not designed to support the wheel. Placing a flat spacer on the lip reduces the amount of lip available and transfers more stress to the wheel bolts. Since the bolts alone were not designed this way, the bolts and the hub will fail eventually. So our R&D dept. came up with an ingenious combined Spacer and Hub Extender that incorporates a new hub with a flat spacer (a true hubcentric 7.5-8mm spacer). The Turner Interlocking Technology Spacers have a bridged support structure that fits in the voids of the unique M3/M4 hub. This gives an interlocking fitment for the spacer with a new full lip for the wheel to rest on. All other M3/M4 7-8mm spacers are now old news and it would be crazy to run a flat spacer instead of these!   Our spacers are manufactured in-house from an aerospace-grade aluminum, then finished in a military-spec hardcoat that is stronger and more durable than normal anodizing. We finish our spacers in a stealthy grey or black color so they blend in with the wheel and hub. We also use the correct diameter spacer so there is no unsightly step between the wheel and hub. The part number and Turner logo are laser engraved for easy identification. Pockets on the backside of the spacer are a Turner Motorsport innovation and aid in removing a stubborn spacer from the hub.    Several styles of wheel bolts or studs are offered for a safe and complete install.                2015+   M3 Sedan  2015+   M4 Coupe  2015+   M4 Convertible",$161.45

Improve handling and stability by increasing track width A spacer fits between the wheel and the hub assembly and pushes the wheel out by the thickness of the spacer. Our wheel spacers are compatible with almost any type of BMW wheel and are a direct fit to the wheel hub (see below for any fitment notes). Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required. These latest generation of the Turner Motorsport Wheel Spacers represent a total redesign of the wheel spacer concept - a ground-up, clean sheet design based on our years of BMW service and motorsports. We took everything we have learned from our service technicians, customers, and race team crew and built the spacer to beat all spacers. We've been in the BMW wheel spacer business probably longer than anybody and when it came time to make our own spacers, a basic spacer design just wouldn't do. We had to make a spacer that is light weight (for lower unsprung mass), has a tough and durable coating to last through our New England winters, is easily removed (your mechanic will thank you), and is precisely engineered and manufactured for a proper fit on the hub and in the wheel. You won't find a better engineered wheel spacer on the market!

Spacers allow you to correct wheel offset issues, clearance for big brakes or suspension or bodywork, to improve handling and stability by increasing track width, or simply to get the right look and stance. Our spacers are engineered precisely for BMWs, with multiple features that other brands don't have, and have been rigorously tested by our race team and on our street project cars. We have the most advanced BMW wheel spacers on the market because we are BMW specialists and we design, engineer, and manufacture them in-house.   Our in-house R&D dept. solved a shortcoming that is inherent with all small flat spacers -    for the wheel to rest on. BMW designs their wheels to fit on the lip protruding from the hub. The bolts alone are not designed to support the wheel. Placing a flat spacer on the lip reduces the amount of lip available and transfers more stress to the wheel bolts. Since the bolts alone were not designed this way, the bolts and the hub will fail eventually. So our R&D dept. came up with an ingenious combined Spacer and Hub Extender that incorporates a new hub with a flat spacer (a true hubcentric 5mm spacer). The Turner Interlocking Technology Spacers have a bridged support structure that fits in the voids of the unique M3/M4 hub. This gives an interlocking fitment for the spacer with a new full lip for the wheel to rest on.

Improve handling and stability by increasing track width A spacer fits between the wheel and the hub assembly and pushes the wheel out by the thickness of the spacer. Our wheel spacers are compatible with almost any type of BMW wheel and are a direct fit to the wheel hub (see below for any fitment notes). Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required. This latest generation of the Turner Motorsport Wheel Spacers represents a total redesign of the wheel spacer concept - a ground-up, clean sheet design based on our years of BMW service and motorsports. We took everything we have learned from our service technicians, customers, and race team crew and built the spacer to beat all spacers. We've been in the BMW wheel spacer business probably longer than anybody and when it came time to make our own spacers, a basic spacer design just wouldn't do. We had to make a spacer that is lightweight (for lower unsprung mass), has a tough and durable coating to last through our New England winters, is easily removed (your mechanic will thank you), and is precisely engineered and manufactured for a proper fit on the hub and in the wheel. You won't find a better engineered wheel spacer on the market! Turner Wheel Spacer Features -- hub-centric design, 1-piece spacer precise tolerance fitment thanks to CAD process and CNC mill machine aerospace grade aluminum light weight but very strong with a high resistance to corrosion additional military-spec hardcoat for further corrosion resistance innovative Quick Release pockets for easy removal (better than a chamfered back edge) laser engraved size and part number for easy identification stealthy anthracite or black color extended bolt sets in factory-matching black or bright silver finish available (wheel stud kits also available) Turner Motorsport track and street tested! Made in the USA Extended Wheel Bolts Longer wheel bolts or wheel studs are required for all BMW wheel spacers. Spacers cannot be used with stock bolts. Our extended lug bolts are very high quality and high-grade steel lug bolt (grade 10.9). We offer two finishes to get you just the right look with your wheels - black zinc to maintain a factory BMW appearance or a bright zinc nickel finish to go with polished wheels. Zinc finishes are designed to withstand 700 hours of salt spray testing. Spacer Specs: bolt pattern: 5 x 112 center bore: 66.56mm hubcentric: yes wheel pad size: normal 5mm spacer note: a 3mm spacer sits on the existing hub lip but leaves less than 9mm of lip for the wheel to rest on. Therefore, wheels that have a bevel around the center bore will not engage the hub lip and may result in vibration.",$94.95

Spacers allow you to correct wheel offset issues, clearance for big brakes or suspension or bodywork, to improve handling and stability by increasing track width, or simply to get the right look and stance. Our spacers are engineered precisely for BMWs, with multiple features that other brands don't have, and have been rigorously tested by our race team and on our street project cars. We have the most advanced BMW wheel spacers on the market because we are BMW specialists and we design, engineer, and manufacture them in-house.   Our in-house R&D dept. solved a shortcoming that is inherent with all small flat spacers -    for the wheel to rest on. BMW designs their wheels to fit on the lip protruding from the hub. The bolts alone are not designed to support the wheel. Placing a flat spacer on the lip reduces the amount of lip available and transfers more stress to the wheel bolts. Since the bolts alone were not designed this way, the bolts and the hub will fail eventually. So our R&D dept. came up with an ingenious combined Spacer and Hub Extender that incorporates a new hub with a flat spacer (a true hubcentric 7.5-8mm spacer). The Turner Interlocking Technology Spacers have a bridged support structure that fits in the voids of the unique M3/M4 hub. This gives an interlocking fitment for the spacer with a new full lip for the wheel to rest on. All other M3/M4 7-8mm spacers are now old news and it would be crazy to run a flat spacer instead of these!   Our spacers are manufactured in-house from an aerospace-grade aluminum, then finished in a military-spec hardcoat that is stronger and more durable than normal anodizing. We finish our spacers in a stealthy grey or black color so they blend in with the wheel and hub. We also use the correct diameter spacer so there is no unsightly step between the wheel and hub. The part number and Turner logo are laser engraved for easy identification. Pockets on the backside of the spacer are a Turner Motorsport innovation and aid in removing a stubborn spacer from the hub.    Several styles of wheel bolts or studs are offered for a safe and complete install.                2015+   M3 Sedan  2015+   M4 Coupe  2015+   M4 Convertible",$131.95
