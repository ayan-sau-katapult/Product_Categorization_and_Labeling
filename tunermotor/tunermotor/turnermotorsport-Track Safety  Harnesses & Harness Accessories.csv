You can use just one pair to accomplish this, or 2 pairs (4 collars total) for the best looking and functioning install. The beauty of these collars (besides being lightweight and looking clean) is that they can be adjusted from side to side, which is convenient if you change you seat or belt configuration. They can also be used for other applications as well, such as taming that helmet net strap. If you're looking for a clean, professional looking solution, these are a superb final touch. As used on our own Championship winning TMS E46 and E90 race cars.      for 1.5"" OD roll bar tubing or for 1.75"" OD roll bar tubing (choose your size below). Check your cage tubing diameter especially if your car was built in Europe as they used metric tubing sizes. If you need a metric size, contact us. Also measure with paint applied, not bare tubing. These are sold by the pair, so be sure to modifying your quantity below (or in the cart) if you need them for both seats."

Schroth has recently tested this harness with a HANS device, and the results were great. So you can in fact use this harness with a HANS device. Another feature unique to the Profi Series 2"" lap belts is the ""Flexi Belt"". The End Fittings and Cam Latches are wrapped into the harness, making it so that the lap belt can be changed from a Pull-Up configuration to a Pull-Down. This allows you to set the belt up just the way you want it for your specific situation. It also allows for Bolt In brackets to be wrapped in for the lap belts if needed.
