The system is hydraulically operated based on instructions from the engine computer. It's very complex and BMW has not yet perfected the system. The VAN0S solenoid is the actuator that takes instruction from the ECU and activates the VANOS unit on the front of the engine. When the solenoid is failing (or failed) you can end up with a rough running engine, misfires, bad fuel economy, lack of power, and more. It should trigger multiple fault codes and a check engine light for misfires, camshaft control, VAN0S solenoid, boost pressure control, and maybe others. It's important to thoroughly troubleshoot fault codes but VAN0S solenoids are a known issue with these engines."

One such point is the S54 Vanos oil line. Normally thought of as a worry-free item, it has proven to put the damper on many track days. Rogue's stainless steel braided VANOS line replaces the factory BMW part number 11367837614 (current MSRP from BMW is $128.08!) The high pressure (1200psi) control system of the S54 vanos system is used to ensure responsive and accurate camshaft adjustments. The added complexity of the high oil pressure used on the S54 vanos means more opportunities for failures. Some customers have encountered the high pressure hardline fail at the track, spraying oil all over their engine compartment, ending their day. Rogue Engineering's S54 Vanos Oil Line is built in their Upper Saddle River, NJ facility, and tested to over 3000psi. Using their stainless steel braided hose with the proper banjo fittings, this a direct replacement for the factory line. Like the factory line, the lower portion of the line uses a heat sleeve from additional heat from the VANOS pump itself. Fits the following BMWs: 2001-06 BMW E46 M3 2001-02 BMW MZ3, including coupe and convertible 2007-08 BMW MZ4, including coupe and convertible"

The VAC Hub has an Upgraded Drive Pin design, which is larger in diameter, as well as more material on the outside wall of the pin. In addition, the hub is made from 4340HT Billet Bar and heat treated to the same BMW OE Rockwell Hardness spec. The upgraded design is not only significantly stronger, but the larger diameter Drive Pins also minimize the huge clearance (approximately 1mm) that was in the original design by BMW and reduces the clearance to 0.2mm. This is critical in helping greatly reduce or eliminate the VANOS noise."

VAN0S is a variable camshaft timing system that uses oil pressure to move camshaft position depending on engine load and demands. VAN0S is always functioning - retarding or advancing the intake and exhaust cams as needed. So when it's not functioning you really feel the difference. The car will be down on power and torque, especially in the mid-range, and your fuel economy will decrease. There may be other telltale signs - camshaft or VAN0S fault codes, misfires and fault codes, and the dreaded ""vanos rattle"" that signs like marbles in a coffee can but is actually the bearings allowing too much play in the VANOS piston shaft. A new VAN0S unit will do wonders for your car's performance!Diagnosis and repair depends on what symptoms you have. Trouble codes and faults can usually be traced to a camshaft position sensor or the solenoid not allowing the VANOS to move. But the rattle is a sure sign that the VAN0S is in need of a rebuild. But be aware that a rattling noise could mean other things as well such as the timing chain or tensioner. The typical lifespan of the Original BMW units is 130-150,000 miles. Our rebuilt VAN0S units use better quality bearings, seals, and o-rings, as well as some other tricks, that work better and last longer. How much longer? We don't really know - in over 10 years of selling rebuilt VAN0S units we've never sold a replacement for them!Our rebuilt and improved dual VANOS units for the M52TU and M54 engines come complete with rebuilt solenoids, all new seals, o-rings, bearings, and the VAN0S cover gasket. It's ready for installation right out of the box. A core charge applies so we can continue to offer rebuilt units at an attractive price (a third of the price of a Genuine BMW unit!). This rebuilt unit is as complete as possible to get back that missing power and smoothness as quickly as possible.1999-2005  323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi1999-2003  525i 528i 530i2004-2006  525i 530i - with M54 engine2004-2006  X3 2.5i X3 3.0i2000-2006  X5 3.0i1999-2002  Z3 2.3 Z3 2.5i Z3 2.8 Z3 3.0i2003-2006  Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i br>"

Early symptoms of timing chain wear include front end noise not associated with VANOS, or slapping noises coming from the timing cover.
