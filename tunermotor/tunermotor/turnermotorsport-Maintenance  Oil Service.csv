Continuous friction in your engine creates tiny metal particles that contaminate the oil. These particles are measured in microns (one millionth of a meter: 25 microns = .001""). Oil filters catch the particles larger than about 35 microns, but they do not remove the smaller particles. Even after an oil change, there are still contaminants left in the engine. Over time, these metal particles are circulated millions of times, polishing (wearing) down the metal components inside your engine, degrading its performance and shortening the engine's life until it wears out. Magnetic drain plugs remove the smaller metal particles the oil filter can't, extending the useful life of your engine. It is also less likely that you will experience oil oxidation, as the metal particles that contribute to the process of oxidation adhere to the magnet. We think Dimple™ makes the finest magnetic drain plugs we've ever used. What makes Dimple™ plugs different from other magnetic drain plugs? The magnets. All magnets are not created equal -- Dimple's ""Black Hole™"" high-temperature magnets are the strongest, high-temperature, neodymium magnets in the world. Regular magnets lose magnetism at 175° F; Dimple's neodymium magnets are rated at over 300° F, so they continue to grab those destructive metal particles even when things get hot. In addition, Dimple's magnets degrade at the incredibly slow rate of ½ of 1% every 100 years, so they are guaranteed to work throughout your lifetime.
