The good news is that the pump only works when, and only as much, as it needs to. That means the system can actually stop the pump when it doesn't need to be running. The bad news is that it's now an electrical part, so a failure is usually immediate and with no warning. The preventative replacement is your only insurance from a very inconvenient and costly breakdown in the future. Plus you get the very latest BMW water pump design with any improvements they've made since your original pump was installed.     With regular driving the hoses should last a very long time. Even the plastic connectors seem to be holding up well. But as a preventative measure new hoses are recommended. We have also seen issues with re-using hoses as the spring connectors get weak over time and may not have the strength to hold the hose in place.

We start with the basic water pump and thermostat bundle. These are already vital to the health and durability of the N52 328i. But to properly maintain these cars for the long term, the rest of the cooling system must be refreshed and preventatively replaced. Here you can add a radiator, expansion tank, all of the 328 cooling hoses, and the BMW antifreeze. This package fits 328i/328xi with N52 engine and automatic transmission. Some of the components are different for the automatic models because of the auto transmission oil cooler.   The sophisticated electronics of the ECU and water pump means catastrophic overheating should be a thing of the past. But the downside is that the electronics can shut down without any warning or symptoms. And troubleshooting is equally frustrating since the water pump electronics are not readable or serviceable. There are several clues to a faulty thermostat or water pump - the fan runs at full speed all the time (even immediately on a cold start), pending (soft) fault code for low coolant flow, or the water pump can be heard running constantly. But when the pump fails it's an immediate shut down of the engine which can be a major inconvenience and lead to additional repairs that might have been avoided with preventative maintance.

This cooling system package is for the 2006-2007 E60 525i/525xi/530i/530xi models with a manual transmission (N52 engine). The radiator is specific to manual transmission models.   Much of the later E60 cooling system is strong and reliable compared to the previous generation 5-series models. But there is still the potential for serious cooling system and engine-related failures. On the N52 engine the electric water pump is the weakest link. It will fail without much warning and shut down the engine. Preventative replacement is the best course of action and the water pump and thermostat should be done before they reach 60,000 miles. Several other cooling components are due for replacement by 100,000 miles to prevent other breakdowns. A failure in the cooling system can lead to overheating and catastrophic engine failure. Don't gamble your engine! By replacing these core items preventatively you are defusing what could be a ticking cooling system time bomb. And if you've had a failure of one of these parts, now is the time to refresh your entire cooling system. Our overhaul package is offered with an OEM Behr radiator, an Original BMW water pump, OEM Behr thermostat, expansion tank, cap, and new radiator hoses.   Our base kit comes with the OEM Behr radiator, OEM Behr thermostat, Original BMW electric water pump with mounting screws, and the u-shaped hose between the pump and thermostat. From there you can add additional items to complete the overhaul.   There are a lot of hoses on the N52 engine. Not all of them need to be replaced during an overhaul but it would be a good idea. The hoses themselves don't wear but the metal spring clips on the connector lose their tension over time and that can lead to a leak. It's worse when re-using a hose after it's already been disconnected. Since our package includes the thermostat, water pump, and radiator we offer all of the hoses related to those components. Use the diagram on the right to see where each is connected in the engine bay. Evaluate your current hoses and then decide which ones to replace. One note about the lower radiator hose: when ordering a new hose you must order a new temp sensor. Do not reuse the original temp sensor as it will leak on the new hose.     2006-2007    525i 525xi 530i 530xi"

The water pump itself won't last more than 100,000 miles in most cases and the engine itself is prone to coolant leaks from multiple locations. So a major 550i cooling system overhaul should be planned before the 100,000 mile mark. Aside from obvious leaks the 550i water pump will also squeal or screech indicating the bearings inside have worn. This package covers the water pump, thermostat, and radiator for the 2006-2010 E60 550i and E63 650i with a manual transmission.The entire cooling system on the 550i is susceptible to leaks and poor performance. The condition of the rest of the cooling system should be considered along with the water pump and thermostat. Replacing the water pump will expose the front of the V8 engine where more problem areas may appear so plan accordingly. The biggest problem is the V8 valley pan gaskets and inner coolant tube seals.

We start with the basic water pump and thermostat bundle. These are already vital to the health and durability of the N54 135/335. But to properly maintain these cars for the long term, the rest of the cooling system must be refreshed and preventatively replaced. Here you can add a radiator, expansion tank, all of the 135/335 cooling hoses, and the BMW antifreeze. This package fits 135/335 with N54 engine and auto transmission. Some of the components are different for the automatic models because of the auto transmission oil cooler.   The sophisticated electronics of the ECU and water pump means catastrophic overheating should be a thing of the past. But the downside is that the electronics can shut down without any warning or symptoms. And troubleshooting is equally frustrating since the water pump electronics are not readable or serviceable. There are several clues to a faulty thermostat or water pump - the fan runs at full speed all the time (even immediately on a cold start), pending (soft) fault code for low coolant flow, or the water pump can be heard running constantly. But when the pump fails it's an immediate shut down of the engine which can be a major inconvenience and lead to additional repairs that might have been avoided with preventative maintance. We recommend a full cooling system overhaul on the E90/E92 every 80-90,000 miles and to check for soft/pending codes at every   .             2008-2010    135i  2007-2010    335i 335xi 335i xDrive - Sedan  2007-2010    335i 335is 335xi 335i xDrive - Coupe  2007-2010    335i - Convertible"

It's worse when re-using a hose after it's already been disconnected. Since our package includes the thermostat, water pump, and radiator we offer all of the hoses related to those components. Use the diagram on the right to see where each is connected in the engine bay. Evaluate your current hoses and then decide which ones to replace.

With better materials over the years we've seen that interval increase and you can now count on your water pump and radiator lasting at least 100,000 miles. That doesn't mean you can set aside preventaive maintenance. A failure in the cooling system can lead to overheating and catastrophic engine failure. Don't gamble your engine! By replacing these core items preventatively, such as the radiator & waterpump, you are defusing what could be a ticking cooling system time bomb. And if you've had a failure of one of these parts, now is the time to refresh your cooling system.       17111469179, radiator (OEM Behr)  11517527799, water pump (OE BMW)  11537511580, 88°C thermostat (OEM Behr/Hella)  11531708499, upper radiator hose (OEM Rein/CRP)  11531726344, lower radiator hose (OEM Rein/CRP)  17111742231, expansion tank cap (OEM Behr/Hella)          Use the options below to build your cooling package.     1992-1999    323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3"

The water pump itself won't last more than 100,000 miles in most cases and the engine itself is prone to coolant leaks from multiple locations. So a major 545i cooling system overhaul should be planned before the 100,000 mile mark. Aside from obvious leaks the 545i water pump will also squeal or screech indicating the bearings inside have worn. This package covers the water pump, thermostat, and radiator for the 2004-2006 E60 545i and E63 645ci with an automatic transmission.The entire cooling system on the 545/645 is susceptible to leaks and poor performance. The condition of the rest of the cooling system should be considered along with the water pump and thermostat. Replacing the water pump will expose the front of the V8 engine where more problem areas may appear so plan accordingly. The biggest problem is the V8 valley pan gaskets and inner coolant tube seals. The tube carrying coolant through the valley is prone to leaking and replacement is a major job (). Additional items recommended to be replaced during the water pump job are: cooling hoses, expansion tank and cap, temp sensors, drive belts, and pulleys and tensioners."
