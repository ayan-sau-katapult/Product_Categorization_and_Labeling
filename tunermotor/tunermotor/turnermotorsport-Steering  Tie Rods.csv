Our rack stops will help protect your investment. Rack stops are spacers that install inside of the tie rod and limits the amount of steering travel. You can save the costs of replacing rubbing tires, worn out brake ducts, cut shock reservoir hoses, and broken underside plastic panels. There is also the added benefit of knowing you can turn the steering wheel to full lock and not be worried that the wheels will rub. Our rack stop length is the approximate length that will be removed from the outside tire wall�s path. For example, if a 16mm rack stop is used, there will be 16mm more clearance for a brake duct between the fender well and the edge of the tire. Included with this kit: 2 Delrin rack stops, 1 black (driver�s side), 1 white (passenger�s side), 2 Locking plates (only needed on E36), 4 zip ties, detailed instructions."
