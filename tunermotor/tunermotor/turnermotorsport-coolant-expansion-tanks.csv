The stock plastic screw can deform over time due to heat or even regular use. We have even seen the head of the screw snap off, leaving the threaded body stuck in the expansion tank. This aluminum screw will help to prevent sudden failure of the bleeder screw, which can result in immediate overheating of the car."

This is the most recent expansion tank design from Hella-Behr, the OEM supplier to BMW. It replaces the original BMW part number 17137787039.   Other items to consider replacing at the same time are the radiator cap, coolant level sensor, lower radiator hose, coolant temp sensor in the lower hose, and the hose clamps. If your car has an automatic transmission you should also replace the oil cooler thermostat in the radiator frame, which is a common source for leaks.      1999-2006    - 323i, 323Ci, 325i, 325Ci, 325xi, 328i, 328Ci, 330i, 330Ci & 330xi (**no M)  2004-2008    - X3 2.5, X3 3.0, X3 3.0si  2000-2005    - X5 3.0"

Here at Turner Motorsport, we found ourselves unsatisfied with all existing solutions to relocate the coolant expansion tank to the cold side of your engine bay, freeing up real estate on the hot side. We decided to make an end all be all solution for people looking to relocate your expansion tank. All CAD designed in-house, our N54 aluminum expansion tank relocation kit allows you to seamlessly mount our new aluminum expansion tank on the cold side of your engine bay, featuring an integrated power steering pump reservoir mount. During the design process, we did everything possible to ensure no air pockets could develop in the cooling system even during spirited drives. The baffled tank is all TIG welded 5052 aluminum construction, featuring a carefully designed bleed passage. We also machined all of our bungs to accept OEM hose ends, to keep the fit and finish as OE+ as possible. Keeping with this same mindset, we made sure that coolant elevation matches OE exactly, and integrated a power steering pump reservoir mount. Our aluminum expansion tank accepts the OE coolant level sensor, bleeder screw, and coolant cap, but we include new ones with this kit, as we thought you should replace them during installation. See more about these features in the list below, and if you have any additional questions please feel free to call into our staff of skilled BMW enthusiasts at 1-800-280-6966. Find our Installation Guide HERE Features and benefits: TIG welded 5052 aluminum construction, wrinkle black powder coated Utilizes factory coolant capacity and expansion volume CAD designed to retain OE coolant elevation, which prevents air pockets Baffled tank ensures that air pockets will not be created under spirited driving conditions, and ensures accurate coolant level reading Meticulously designed bleed passage prevents air pockets while the engine cools All bungs machined for factory hose end compatibility (no barb fittings!) Integrated power steering reservoir mount Kit includes Turner Motorsport aluminum expansion tank, Turner Motorsport wiring harness, all necessary hoses, hardware, OE level sensor, bleeder screw, and coolant cap This product fits the following BMWs: 2008-2013 E82 135i 2007-2013 E88 135i"
