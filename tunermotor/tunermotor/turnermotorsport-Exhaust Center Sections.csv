Fan of the rasp that comes from the S54 engine? This front exhaust section replaces the single resonator in the US exhaust (or the cats in Euro models) with a straight-through pipe. This can be a direct bolt-on to the stock or Euro headers and includes rear O2 sensor ports (for Euro models, must be plugged for US models). You can use this with the Supersprint resonator delete section 2 pipe for the max rasp effect. Or mount it with any other section 2 exhaust to fine-tune your sound. Supersprint exhaust is widely recognized as the leader in complete exhaust system upgrades - extremely high quality, well designed for optimal flow, and amazing sound. Even at a premium price, Supersprint is an unbeatable exhaust system because every aspect is done to such a high level. A Supersprint exhaust rewards you with a terrific sound, long-lasting construction, and excellent fitment. The Supersprint sound is very 'European' which fits the sporting sophistication of BMWs perfectly. Most systems are also modular - sections can be added or removed to custom tailor the exhaust sound to your preference. Aside from 'Race' systems, their mufflers meet European noise laws so you get a refined and tuned sound without being excessively loud. Supersprint exhausts generally run at a premium over other systems but no other system on the market can match their quality, performance, or reputation!

Deleting the resonator will add a bit more volume and makes the system less restrictive for a modest power and torque increase.

Supersprint exhaust is widely recognized as the leader in complete exhaust system upgrades - extremely high quality, well designed for optimal flow, and amazing sound. Even at a premium price Supersprint is an unbeatable exhaust system because every aspect is done to such a high level. A Supersprint exhaust rewards you with a terrific sound, long lasting construction and excellent fitment. The Supersprint sound is very 'European' which fits the sporting sophistication of BMWs perfectly. Most systems are also modular - sections can be added or removed to custom tailor the exhaust sound to your preferance. Aside from 'Race' systems, their mufflers meet European noise laws so you get a refined and tuned sound without being excessively loud. Most Supersprint systems are built with larger diameter piping to improve exhaust flow which helps the engine do less work and make more horsepower! Supersprint exhausts generally run at a premium over other systems but no other system on the market can match their quality, performance, or reputation!     Fitment Note: This resonator section was designed to be used only with a Supersprint section 1 and Supersprint mufflers. Custom fabrication by an exhaust professional will be required to use these with any other system (but it is possible).     2008-2011    M3 - Sedan  2008-2013    M3 - Coupe  2008-2013    M3 - Convertible"

Fortunately, Supersprint has the reputation covered when it comes to BMW exhausts. For over 60 years their goal has always been designing and building the highest quality exhaust available. This has been achieved through extensive testing using real race teams to get the best feedback there is to offer, from the ones who demand the best every day. Extensive dyno testing, high-quality materials, and race team feedback are what allow Supersprint to extract the power from your engine, not just the noise. Supersprint sport cats for the V8 are designed to work with their performance headers and replace the stock main cats. The Supersprint sport cats are much freer-flowing than a factory-style cat. With less restriction, less effort is required to move the exhaust gasses which will free up horsepower and torque. This cat section will mount to the Supersprint merge collectors and then to a Supersprint or stock section 2. These are built with O2 sensor bungs pre-installed after the cat which makes for an easy install."

Supersprint exhausts generally run at a premium over other systems but no other system on the market can match their quality, performance, or reputation! Supersprint metallic sport catalytic converters are sourced from HJS of Germany. For 30 years HJS has been supplying motorsports teams with sport cats when rules required them. HJS is now a worldwide leader in sport cat technology and performance. Rally cars, German DTM, and Formula 3 all rely on HJS for clean, reliable horsepower. Supersprint works closely with HJS to spec a catalytic converter that is correct for the vehicle and engine package. This allows for a substantial increase in flow but which, at the same time, keeps the environmental specs within European limits. With any high-flow catalytic converter, special software or other work may be required to keep emissions fault codes and check engine lights from displaying. Supersprint catalytic converters are sold for track and other off-road uses only."

Supersprint sport cats for the Z4 M are designed to work with their cat-less headers or to replace factory US cats. The Supersprint sport cats are much freer-flowing than a traditional stock cat. With less restriction, less effort is required to move the exhaust gasses which will free up horsepower and torque. This cat section will mount to the Supersprint headers (p/n 787501) and then to any section 2. This section is built with O2 sensor bungs pre-installed after the cat if you wanted to extend your stock post-cat O2 sensors (however, special software may still be needed). Supersprint exhaust is widely recognized as the leader in complete exhaust system upgrades - extremely high quality, well designed for optimal flow, and amazing sound. Even at a premium price, Supersprint is an unbeatable exhaust system because every aspect is done to such a high level. A Supersprint exhaust rewards you with a terrific sound, long-lasting construction, and excellent fitment. The Supersprint sound is very 'European' which fits the sporting sophistication of BMWs perfectly. Most systems are also modular - sections can be added or removed to custom tailor the exhaust sound to your preference.

Supersprint exhausts generally run at a premium over other systems but no other system on the market can match their quality, performance, or reputation!   Supersprint metallic sport catalytic converters are sourced from HJS of Germany. For 30 years HJS has been supplying motorsports teams with sport cats when rules required them. HJS is now a worldwide leader in sport cat technology and performance. Rally cars, German DTM, and Formula 3 all rely on HJS for clean, reliable horsepower. Supersprint works closely with HJS to spec a catalytic converter that is correct for the vehicle and engine package. This allows for a substantial increase in flow but which, at the same time, keeps the environmental specs within European limits. With any high-flow catalytic converter, special software or other work may be required to keep emissions fault codes and check engine lights from displaying. Supersprint catalytic converters are sold for track and other off-road uses only.          2009+    Z4 sDrive35i Z4 sDrive35is"
