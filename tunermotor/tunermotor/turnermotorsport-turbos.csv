The kit includes a bolt-on billet aluminum adapter that bolts directly onto the stock turbo with an extension hose, shut-off valve, and 30 PSI boost gauge to comfortably and safely apply pressure to the charge pipe system. This kit is designed to AVOID pressurizing the fragile PCV system by testing right at the turbo inlet instead of anywhere before the turbo inlet. This boost leak tester will pressurize the whole charge pipe path and detect any leaks from the turbo to the motor. This includes faulty diverter/bov's, clamped connections in the charge pipe, FMIC, intercooler connections, seals, hoses, and all connections at the intake manifold like vacuum and boost lines, injector o-rings... Basically, everything the turbo normally pressurizes. Pressurizing the charge pipe system will allow you to run at the peak boost your motor was tuned for and ensure you are putting all the power down - without any leaks. A boost leak will cause the compressor wheels to over-spin to compensate for the lost pressure. This causes shaft play. Oil is superheated and causes the bearings to wear with more play. Left alone, this is what chews up the turbine and compressor wheels.

Signs of a failing turbo are high oil consumption and blue smoke from exhaust (not from a leak or failing CCV system) because the internal oil seals are no longer retaining oil. Without critical lubrication and cooling effects from oil, the turbo shafts and bearings are usually the first to wear and that requires a complete rebuild.

You will need to remove the air box (or your aftermarket air filters) to expose the 2 intake pipes. Install the testers in each pipe and pressurize the system using the tire schrader with your tire inflation tool. The kit comes with the necessary caps to block the diverter valve return flanges on the intake pipes, also a cap to block the breather line at the bakc of the valve cover. Once the kit is installed, use compressed air to charge the system and you will see that both gauges read the compressor pressure you are filling with. You'll be able to test the turbo to the motor checking all leak points in between, including intercooler, clamped connections, intake manifold, divertor valves and the many random potential leak points. Note: Testing at the intake pipe, you may hear noise coming from the o-ring (at ~12 psi test pressure) that seals the intake pipe to the turbo inlet from debris. This is not a boost leak, these are not meant to see boost and not intended to be perfectly sealed, however hearing this hissing may be mis-diagnosed as a leak. In this case reduce the pressure. If no obvious leaks are heard in any other location, the test is complete and there are no significant leaks The gauge on the boost leak tester allows the user to: apply a safe amount of pressure to prevent injury or damage to the charge pipes or engine read how fast the system holds and bleeds air after removing the air source give a good comparison of compressor outlet air Vs. boost test air while pressurizing.

This is a complete assembly, including the manifold to the engine and the wastegate. It's highly likely N54 turbos will have to be replaced before 100,000 miles. Signs of a failing turbo are high oil consumption and blue smoke from exhaust (not from a leak or failing CCV system) because the internal oil seals are no longer retaining oil. Without critical lubrication and cooling effects from oil, the turbo shafts and bearings are usually the first to wear and that requires a complete rebuild. You might also see increased turbo lag or failure to hold boost, which is usually a sign of a failing wastegate or some other internal issue. With any internal problems, the turbos need to be replaced. This is a new turbo - No core charge."

Relocating the inlets on your N54 with the ARM Inlets increase the power and torque of your N54 up to 60whp/60wtq. Expect improved turbo spool, faster peak boost, and more volume from the turbochargers on your N54. If you're looking to max out your stock or upgraded twin turbochargers these are a must! Highlights: Gains of up to 60whp/60wtq Quicker Turbo Spool Increased Turbo Volume One of the greatest challenges when upgrading to relocated inlets on your N54 is mitigating the heat of the air induced by the turbos. With the inlets relocated to the passenger-side the filters are closer to the turbochargers where temperatures are hotter. The ARM N54 Inlets come with a manifold heat shield which serves to help keep heat down near the turbos and away from the inlet filters. This also assists with keeping heat away from the inlet tubes themselves. In addition, the ARM Inlets come with an air filter heat shield which assists in keeping the cooler air near the filters separate from hotter air coming from the engine adjacent to it. The air filters on the ARM Inlets are secured in place with a filter bracket which prevents filters and inlets themselves from bouncing around during acceleration, braking, and cornering.

The stock turbos are quickly maxed out and aren't quite up to the task of generating large amounts of power reliably. To solve this, Pure Turbos offers their Stage 2 turbo upgrade package for those who are looking to increase power up to 700+whp reliably with supporting modifications. These upgraded OEM turbos carry over some of the best design features of Pure Turbos: Upgraded high flow turbine wheel Upgraded billet compressor wheel Large pad, heavy-duty thrust CNC machined and high-speed VSR balanced Direct fit, as OEM, as these utilize OEM housings.

The kit includes a bolt-on billet aluminum adapter that bolts directly onto the stock turbo with an extension hose, shut-off valve, and 30 PSI boost gauge to comfortably and safely apply pressure to the charge pipe system. This kit is designed to AVOID pressurizing the fragile N55 PCV system by testing right at the turbo inlet instead of anywhere before the turbo inlet. This boost leak tester will pressurize the whole charge pipe path and detect any leaks from the turbo to the motor. This includes faulty diverter/bov's, clamped connections in the charge pipe, FMIC, intercooler connections, seals, hoses, and all connections at the intake manifold like vacuum and boost lines, injector o-rings... Basically, everything the turbo normally pressurizes Pressurizing the charge pipe system will allow you to run at the peak boost your motor was tuned for and ensure you are putting all the power down - without any leaks. A boost leak will cause the compressor wheels to over-spin to compensate for the lost pressure. This causes shaft play. Oil is superheated and causes the bearings to wear with more play. Left alone, this is what chews up the turbine and compressor wheels.

Relocating the inlets on your N54 with the ARM Inlets increase the power and torque of your N54 up to 60whp/60wtq. Expect improved turbo spool, faster peak boost, and more volume from the turbochargers on your N54. If you're looking to max out your stock or upgraded twin turbochargers these are a must! Highlights: Gains of up to 60whp/60wtq Quicker Turbo Spool Increased Turbo Volume One of the greatest challenges when upgrading to relocated inlets on your N54 is mitigating the heat of the air induced by the turbos. With the inlets relocated to the passenger-side the filters are closer to the turbochargers where temperatures are hotter. The ARM N54 Inlets come with a manifold heat shield which serves to help keep heat down near the turbos and away from the inlet filters. This also assists with keeping heat away from the inlet tubes themselves. In addition, the ARM Inlets come with an air filter heat shield which assists in keeping the cooler air near the filters separate from hotter air coming from the engine adjacent to it. The air filters on the ARM Inlets are secured in place with a filter bracket which prevents filters and inlets themselves from bouncing around during acceleration, braking, and cornering. Also included with the ARM Inlets is a support bracket for the boost solenoids. This keeps them locked into place during extreme driving. To help make installation easy, relocation brackets for the coolant reservoir and power steering pump reservoir are included with the ARM Inlets. Kit Includes: ARM Relocated Inlets Manifold Heat Shield Air Filter Head Shield Coolant Reservoir Relocation Brackets Power Steering Reservoir Relocation Bracket Boost Solenoid Bracket Clamps"

It's called the ""Game Changer"" because Vargas was the first to introduce 750whp-rated turbos that fit in the stock location. To get this kind of power (750whp equals roughly 900 crank hp) Vargas had to build new turbos from the ground up. Every part on these turbos were designed around Vargas' specific goals for power, flow, and reliability but with the requirement that they fit in the stock location. Turbo housings are cast in stainless steel and flow-optimized for the stock location with bigger billet aluminum compressor and turbine wheels. All of the other internals have been optimized for this design to achieve 750whp rating. Particular attention was given to spool time to reduce turbo lag. While more lag than a stock or GC-Lite kit, the Stage 2 lag has been minimized as much as possible. Silicone inlet and turbo manifold piping is included (see notes below)."
