This tool kit includes a flywheel locating lock pin, and a special set of camshaft locators that lock the cams in a precise location. The tools are very easy to install. The kit is specifically designed to hold the engine and cams in proper timing during the cylinder head removal and re installation process. This avoids the chance of bending the valves doing the head install process. The precision ground holding blocks lock over the square ends of both intake and exhaust cams. The CNC machined flywheel locating pin passes through a hole in the rear of the engine block and passed through a machined hole in the flywheel.To avoid improper cam timing on the latest BMW engines, the factory has devised a cam timing system that locks the crankshaft and cams into a specific position prior to cylinder head removal. This method was devised to avoid any misalignment, resulting in piston to valve damage. Unfortunately without these tools re-timing the camshafts after a valve job is almost impossible. The factory specification manual does not supply installation specifications. This cam timing kit includes all the necessary components to do the job.1990-1991  318i 318is 318ic1992-1998  318i 318is 318ti 318ic 323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M31999-2005  323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi"
