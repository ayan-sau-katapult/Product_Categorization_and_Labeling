It contains a rubber-isolated bearing that allows the strut shaft to move independently from the rest of the suspension - a critical component for the suspension to be quiet and effective. The rubber also absorbs vibrations and impact harshness, helping to keep unwanted noise and harshness from reaching the steering wheel."

BMW also used it as the lower bushing on most M cars. It makes a great upgrade on all non-M cars where BMW used a rubber bushing at the lower position.This sealed ball joint is one of the best things about the rear suspension - it functions extremely well and lasts a long time. And it can be used as a replacement for the existing bushing without any further modification. The non-M cars used a solid rubber bushing for the lower arm (camber arm, wishbone) which does not last very long and relies on bushing deflection (twist) during suspension motions. The ball joint inside the upgraded design is much more effective during this suspension movements as it does not bind or deflect. And because it's sealed with rubber it will last a long time and remain quiet and maintenance free. Most customers report that after installing or ""upgrading"" to these bushings the rear end of their car felt much more stable.Price is per bushing. Left/Right and Upper/Lower are the same part."

While rubber and urethane bushings flex during load, the toe can change widely giving you nervous and unpredictable handling. These RTABs have a solid aluminum housing with a high-quality sealed OE bearing. These bushings were developed from years of competition use in various racing and HPDE events. There is simply no better RTAB unless your racing class rules prohibit the use of mono or spherical bearings.The rear trailing arm bushings take a lot of abuse from acclerating, braking and cornering. The stock rubber bushings are just not up to the task of keeping rear wheel alignment in spec for very long, especially if you have upgraded to stickier tires and a better suspension. The pliable rubber flexes and twists which slows down reaction time and leaves you with a car that feels nervous and 'tail happy'. Urethane helps to control the alignment but issues with fitment, maintenance, and longevity keep us from recommending urethane on anything but a street car. We also offer a Delrin RTAB for cars that must conform to certain racing class rules. These sealed spherical bearings are the best at controlling rear toe alignment.Our aluminum RTABs are very well made - high grade aluminum alloy and steel CNC'd out of a billet by an ISO 9001 certified manufacturer, each component is either hardcoated or nickel plated. While multiple manufacturers offer two piece designs, our research showed that a one piece bushing is a better design featuring a sealed bearing to keep contaminants out extending the life of the bearing."

The rear suspension feels loose and lacks precision. As rubber or hydroelastic bushings wear the bushing deflection gets worse. If you have a highly tuned 335i/xi you're putting even more strain on weak bushings. The solution is a stiffer and more durable material. Even BMW has moved to solid mounts on the F10 M5 and F8X M3/M4. These fully solid E82/E90/E92 aluminum mounts have zero deflection - the subframe does not move at all. The rest of the suspension can work as designed and maintain the proper alignment and motion ratios. The driver will notice the difference as the car is more stable and the handling is more precise.

While OE rubber bushings are fine when they are new from the factory, aged and worn out rubber bushings create a multitude of issues that can range from annoying to dangerous. As a factory bushing ages, it begins to harden and become brittle. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point. At this point, the differential is free to shift under load causing a noticeable clunking noise under acceleration and deceleration and massively increasing the stress on the driveshaft and axles. Manual transmissions suffer the worst from this as it can make shifting difficult since the differential will shift when the clutch is engaged and disengaged."

Even BMW has moved to solid mounts on the F10 M5 and F8X M3/M4. These fully solid F2x/F3x aluminum mounts have zero deflection - the subframe does not move at all. The rest of the suspension can work as designed and maintain the proper alignment and motion ratios. The driver will notice the difference as the car is more stable and the handling is more precise.

At this point, the differential is free to shift under load causing a noticeable clunking noise under acceleration and deceleration and massively increasing the stress on the driveshaft and axles.

This ECS rear shock mount combines the precision and articulation of a spherical bearing with the isolation of urethane bushings. The stainless monoball bearing is lined with PTFE lubricant and suspended in 80A urethane and housed in a hard anodized 6061-T6 aluminum mount. The spherical bearing is a better design than most rear shock mounts because it allows the shock to move and tilt without side-loading the shock shaft (which leads to premature failure of the shock). Most Genuine BMW and aftermarket shock mounts are not designed for shock angles and the stress that track or performance driving will put on the shock shaft. The ECS shock mount is properly designed to handle these loads. The internal bearing is also replaceable - it will be years before you have to replace the entire mount. The ECS mount is fully encapsulated to prevent the common shock mount failure of the stock mount design.

When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point.

You get sloppy steering, vibrations, and poor handling which makes the car feel unstable. These urethane bushings are stiffer than stock rubber and will not deflect as much. This helps keep the alignment in check with less variation. The car feels more planted and confidence-inspiring. And a lifetime warranty means you'll likely never have to pay for another bushing ever again! Powerflex polyurethane subframe bushings are firmer than OEM bushings, resulting in better handling, a more planted rear-end, and more efficient suspension articulation - all with minimal sacrifice to ride quality. Powerflex is the number one selling suspension bushing manufacturer in Europe. Their experience with polyurethane bushing material and state-of-the art manufacturing techniques allows them to produce premium performance bushings, made to exact-fit standards. Powerflex performance polyurethane bushings are built to last longer than OEM rubber bushings, while improving performance and allowing for a more engaging driving experience. Use of Powerflex Copper Grease PCG1 is recommended for ease of installation. Periodic reapplication is recommended to extend squeak-free service life of bushings. Powerflex street bushings are ideal for street driven vehicles and those that see occasional autocross or track time. Need bushings for a dedicated track car? Powerflex Black Series bushings are the ultimate in track and race bushings. Featuring 95A durometer polyurethane, Black Series bushings are 25% stiffer than street bushings. Powerflex is proud to offer a lifetime warranty to the original purchaser on all products."

As these cars age, they require a number of suspension bushings to be replaced. Bushing replacement not only keeps the car in its top form, it also makes the car safer. Depending on the work, it may be logical to replace all of the bushings in the rear suspension (there are 19 total). This is especially true if you are pulling the subframe out to do the floor reinforcement or if you're doing a diff install. Turner Motorsport is a big believer in using rubber bushings for street cars (with the exception of solid subframe mounts, see further below). Urethanes, Delrin, or aluminum are generally good for reducing compliance and limiting deflection - attributes that don't really work well on roads filled with potholes, railroad crossings, cracks, and expansion joints. The rubber bushings maintain the factory ride/handling traits that won the E46 praise all over the world. Every bushing will need maintenance or replacement at some point and rubber has proven to last the longest and need less maintenance than anything else, even urethane. And unless competitive driving is your goal, the harder materials are only a gimmick."

As these cars age, they require a number of suspension bushings to be replaced. Bushing replacement not only keeps the car in its top form, it also makes the car safer. Depending on the work, it may be logical to replace all of the bushings in the rear suspension (there are 19 total). This is especially true if you are pulling the subframe out to do the floor reinforcement or if you're doing a diff install. Turner Motorsport is a big believer in using rubber bushings for street cars (with the exception of solid subframe mounts, see further below). Urethanes, Delrin, or aluminum are generally good for reducing compliance and limiting deflection - attributes that don't really work well on roads filled with potholes, railroad crossings, cracks, and expansion joints. The rubber bushings maintain the factory ride/handling traits that won the E36 praise all over the world. Every bushing will need maintenance or replacement at some point and rubber has proven to last the longest and need less maintenance than anything else, even urethane.

If your car is not feeling as crisp, has irregular tire wear, or has inconsistent (and unsafe) handling it's likely the rear bushings. We put together this package as a total overhaul to restore your car back to its original feel. Depending on the symptoms and diagnosis from your mechanic, it may be logical to replace all of the bushings in the rear suspension (there are 19 total). This is especially true if the subframe is being removed to repair or reinforce the rear floor (prone to failure).   Turner Motorsport is a big believer in using rubber bushings for street cars. Urethanes, Delrin, or aluminum are generally good for reducing compliance and limiting deflection - attributes that don't really work well on roads filled with potholes, railroad crossings, cracks, and expansion joints. The rubber bushings maintain the factory ride/handling traits that won the 3-series praise all over the world. Every bushing will need maintenance or replacement at some point and rubber has proven to last the longest and need less maintenance than anything else, even urethane. And unless competitive driving is your goal, the harder materials are only a gimmick.       - our OEM rubber replacement trailing arm bushings (RTABs) are a perfect fit and help maintain rear toe alignment. The Limiters prevent premature bushing wear.    - new stock inner rubber bushings for the upper spring arm and the lower camber arm. These do not wear out very quickly but should be replaced as a 'While you're in there...' job.    - outer ball joints for the upper spring arm and the lower camber arm. These are the standard ball joint design found on the M3 and are a direct replacement upgrade on the other E46 models.    - Our very best JT Designs rear shock mounts with gaskets and hardware. If your mounts have not been replaced in the last 40,000 miles, now is the perfect time. Skip this option if you recently replaced mounts or already have an upgraded mount.    - Even if your shock mounts are new or recent, the sheetmetal of the rear shock tower can still fatigue, leaving you with a very dangerous and expensive fix. These reinforcements are extra-thick, providing crucial strength to one of the weakest points on the car. They work with nearly every shock mount.    - Now is a great time to replace the rubber-isolated differential mounts. The diff mounts take the bulk of the twisting and binding as power is transmitted through the differential. We use a Meyle HD rubber bushing for the rear mount as it's stronger than the factory part.    The heart of the rear suspension, the subframe (or carrier) mounts located the entire rear suspension to the car. There are four mounts in total and bolt up into the rear floor. Worn subframe mounts are one of the leading contributors to rear floor-subframe failure. As the mounts flex, so does the sheetmetal of the chassis, which will fatigue the sheetmetal and crack the spot welds. Therefore, replacement of the subframe mounts is critical and a must when doing the subframe reinforcement or repair.     1999-2005    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi"

When it comes to control arms on the track, making them as stiff as you can (usually using solid mounts) is the best way to increase your driving precision by eliminating the deflection of rubber. The next best thing to create a balance would be to stiffen up the control arm with polyurethane, giving you the option of a more stock like feel with 80a or closer to the solid feel with 95a durometers."

Since these replace your stock strut bearings they are designed to work with a stock-type spring only. And when installed correctly will not significantly alter ride height. Adjustment is easily done by loosening the three nuts on top of the tower and sliding the camber plate into the position you want, then re-tighten the nuts. These mounts can be installed two ways - for camber correction or swapped side-side for increasing negative camber. Detailed instructions included.

IRP has created their pillow-ball rear shock mounts for just this need. These rear shock mounts are designed for use on the track and racing. This set of mounts will help your rear shocks perform the best they can in all conditions. The advantage to using a mount with spherical bearing is that it allows the shock to freely move off axis without side loading the shock shaft like rubber or polyurethane mounts do. Side loading a shock increases stiction and wear which decreases its efficiency. Because these are mounts without an isolator (rubber or polyurethane) to dampen road noise and vibrations we do not recommend them for street cars.

While OE rubber bushings are fine when they are new from the factory, aged and worn out rubber bushings create a multitude of issues that can range from annoying to dangerous. As a factory bushing ages, it begins to harden and become brittle. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point. At this point, the differential is free to shift under load causing a noticeable clunking noise under acceleration and deceleration and massively increasing the stress on the driveshaft and axles. Manual transmissions suffer the worst from this as it can make shifting difficult since the differential will shift when the clutch is engaged and disengaged."

The stock rubber bushings have serious drawbacks when used hard on the racetrack - they wear out quickly, and the flexible material allows extreme changes in alignment. Switching to solid bushings will eliminate the deflection and flex, keeping the suspension motions in their intended alignment and providing more feedback to the driver. On the E46 M3, solid bushings can help prevent rear subframe failure as the sheetmetal chassis will no longer flex along with the rubber mount. Depending on the bushing's intended purpose, the material we use is either aluminum or Delrin. Delrin is a dense plastic material that has almost zero deflection and long life. It's self-lubricating so it won't ever need grease or lube. All of our bushings are designed by our in-house R&D engineers and tested on our various racing cars, with many used in professional racing series around the world.   If you're building a car for a racing class, the parts and materials you can change to are specified in the rules. Consult your rulebook or tech steward for any clarification. As these bushings have no play or deflection in them, they are not intended for street-focused cars - they do not absorb impacts and vibration like rubber will.     subframe mounts x 4 (aluminum)  inner-upper control arm bushings x 2 (aluminum with bearing)  differential mounts x 3 (1 Delrin, 2 aluminum)  outer upper/lower control arm bushings x 4 (OE-spec replacements) (steel with bearing)  trailing arm bushings (RTABs) x 2 (aluminum with bearing or Delrin)  suggested: front control arm bushings (FCABs) (Delrin)  suggested: rear shock mounts (RSMs) x 2 (aluminum with bearing)     Note 1: there is also a inner-lower camber arm bushing. We never developed a solid bushing for this point because every racing class allows adjustable camber arms to be used in this location and we offer those with solid inner bushings.  Note 2: some racing classes require a non-bearing bushing for the rear trailing arm bushings. In cases like this, we use a Delrin bushing.  Note 3: the outer upper and lower bushings are already a monoball-style bearing from the factory on all M3 models. They are a great design and last a long time. We offer them here as direct replacements.     2001-2006    M3 M3 CSL"

They've designed them offset to re-center the wheel and give your e30/e36 the correct caster. They will include a stainless-steel insert that tightly presses over the hex pattern on the E46 control arms. You do not need to grind down your control arms or make any other modifications to your chassis. Please note that you will need to use E36 outer tie rods and E90 inner tie rods when installing in an E30 or E36.

While OE rubber bushings are fine when they are new from the factory, aged and worn out rubber bushings create a multitude of issues that can range from annoying to dangerous. As a factory bushing ages, it begins to harden and become brittle. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point.

On a tuned 335i you may have noticed more driveline shudder or problems hooking up during hard launches. What happens is the stock rubber bushings are under constant flex as engine torque is transmitted through the differential. Under normal driving with a stock car the bushings are rarely stressed. But factor in significant additional torque from a tuned N54/N55 and the stock rubber will quickly show its weaknesses. You may have even broken a diff bolt or two as the heavy differential shifts around. Even non-turbo E82 and E9X models may benefit from fresh bushings.This is a set of stock rubber bushings, made by OEM supplier Lemforder. They are the same as the Genuine BMW E9X diff mount bushings, but without the more expensive branding. If you're turned off by potential side effects of urethane or Delrin then the OEM diff mounts are your best option. The OEM mounts fit and perform just like the originals so there is no second guessing their quality. If you're looking for an upgrade we offer  that work well, even in street applications.E9X Diff Mount Set includes:"

The OEM bushings from Lemforder are filled with heavy fluid to help dampen vibrations and rough road surfaces that can make their way up through the chassis and into the steering. As the bushing wears, is compressed and expanded, and subjected to harsh environments the fluid can leak out or evaporate which will leave the bushing without much strength. This can lead to a shimmy in the steering wheel and vibrations in the braking and handling that are often mis-diagnosed as warped brake rotors on the E39 and E38. Replacing these bushings with new parts will restore the precision and tightness to your steering and suspension.The BMW part numbers for these arms are 31 12 1 092 609 and 31 12 1 092 610."

The original factory bushings are fluid filled and rely on the fluid to absorb vibration and resist deflection. When the fluid is gone the rubber left over cannot match the original bushing's strength. The left over rubber is not stiff enough to resist the movements from the suspension. The result is a lot of vibration and reduced feedback and response from the steering.   Meyle has addressed this issue with bushings that are not fluid-filled. The bushing is made of solid rubber that will last longer than the original bushing and is a bit stiffer than new originals for better response and feel. The lack of play from the solid rubber design will mean sharper steering, restoring much of the car's precision and 'connected' feel. Meyle is a German brand in business since 1958 and all of their products are TUV approved and meet or exceed ISO standards. All Meyle HD parts come with a 4-year, unlimited mileage warranty.   This bushing replaces the one pressed into the upper control arm - otherwise known as a tension strut or strut support arm. It's the arm with the twist.

Tasked with keeping suspension geometry in check while absorbing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) factory rubber bushings were engineered to provide a balance of comfort and control. As a factory bushing ages, it becomes brittle and begins to harden. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow excess play in the suspension joint. This is typically felt by a sudden jerk forward after the car comes to a stop and is a leading cause of ""sloppy"" or ""loose"" suspension feel. By replacing the bushing with a full polyurethane unit or using a bushing insert, this play is eliminated since the suspension joint is being supported by a much stiffer material that will not harden or shrink over time. Additionally, the inherent stiffness of the urethane material translates body forces much more directly. This means steering inputs from the driver are effectively transferred to the wheels and vital road information is transmitted properly from the wheels to the driver."

Thick Delrin casings are used as the non-metallic solid mount. High quality aluminum sleeves, with increased surface area, are then pressed into each of the casings with washers integrated into each one. The washers are employed to add an extra safety factor for securing the sub-frame into position.   A BMWs sub-frame is the heart of the suspension and we have found with a short amount of track time the stock bushings will start to degrade. When the sub-frame moves, so do all the suspension mounting points. Replace the stock rubber bushings to limit drivetrain and suspension movement and keep your car setup the way it�s supposed to be.

But please note that some shocks and coil overs come with all or some of these pieces already. If in doubt, check with your supplier on what is included.    We offer three varieties of the rear shock mounts - OEM, Repair Shop, and HP alum-rubber. We recommend either the Repair Shop or HP mounts because the stock OEM design has a flaw that can lead to premature failure of the mounts. The Repair Shop and HP mounts use a different design that will last longer and the Repair Shop mounts also have a lifetime warranty!      1998-2002    M Roadster M Coupe"
