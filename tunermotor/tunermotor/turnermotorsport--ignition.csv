Colder spark plugs work by pulling more heat out of the engine's cylinders (making them ""colder"") and dissipating it into the engine's head, which is then cooled by the cooling system. Depending on how you have your engine built, these could be a great addition! Colder plugs can help prevent engine knock and prevent the tip of the spark plug from melting or misfiring. There are two rules that most people tend to go by when deciding on which spark plugs to buy: The first rule of thumb is that with every 100 horsepower added, you should run spark plugs that are a step colder than your stock plugs. This is generally accepted across the motorsports community but unfortunately isn't always the most accurate measurement of when you will need colder plugs. The second rule is to go a step colder any time you massively alter cylinder temperatures by adding forced induction to an NA engine, by increasing compression ratio, after altering timing in a major way, or by changing fuel types to something with a higher octane rating such as racing fuel. Adding spark plugs that are a step colder outside of these conditions, with no real change to the engine, can actually hurt more than help by leading to spark plugs fouling quicker than normal and by making the car harder to start in cold weather conditions. We suggest talking to your engine builder or tuner before making the change, or you can call our Turner Motorsport sales staff to discuss what modifications have been made to your vehicle and see if these plugs are right for you!"

This is generally accepted across the motorsports community but unfortunately isn't always the most accurate measurement of when you will need colder plugs. The second rule is to go a step colder any time you massively alter cylinder temperatures by adding forced induction to an NA engine, by increasing compression ratio, after altering timing in a major way, or by changing fuel types to something with a higher octane rating such as racing fuel. Adding spark plugs that are a step colder outside of these conditions, with no real change to the engine, can actually hurt more than help by leading to spark plugs fouling quicker than normal and by making the car harder to start in cold weather conditions. We suggest talking to your engine builder or tuner before making the change, or you can call our Turner Motorsport sales staff to discuss what modifications have been made to your vehicle and see if these plugs are right for you!"

There are two rules that most people tend to go by when deciding on which spark plugs to buy: The first rule of thumb is that with every 100 horsepower added, you should run spark plugs that are a step colder than your stock plugs. This is generally accepted across the motorsports community but unfortunately isn't always the most accurate measurement of when you will need colder plugs. The second rule is to go a step colder any time you massively alter cylinder temperatures by adding forced induction to an NA engine, by increasing compression ratio, after altering timing in a major way, or by changing fuel types to something with a higher octane rating such as racing fuel. Adding spark plugs that are a step colder outside of these conditions, with no real change to the engine, can actually hurt more than help by leading to spark plugs fouling quicker than normal and by making the car harder to start in cold weather conditions. We suggest talking to your engine builder or tuner before making the change, or you can call our Turner Motorsport sales staff to discuss what modifications have been made to your vehicle and see if these plugs are right for you!"

With a faulty coil the spark plug is not burning the air/fuel mixture properly and that can lead to problems anywhere in the engine and exhaust (including catalytic converters and O2 sensors). Problems with one or more coils will cause a fault code but not always a check engine light. A misfire code may be related to an ignition coil but could be from other things as well. Sometimes a visual inspection of a coil and coil boot will give an indication of a failure. You can also move coils around to different cylinder banks to see if the misfire code follows a suspect coil. We suggest always having one or two coils on hand to keep as spares.

Every component in this kit meets or exceeds OEM quality and features premium seals for dust and water resistance. While coils do not directly increase horsepower, stock BMW coils can wear out quickly, resulting in underperforming voltage and current output. This often leads to weaker spark intensity and reduced power output. Due to the increased voltage and current output, many customers have seen as much as 20+ whp/wtq gained by switching to Precision Raceworks coils over all other coils on the market! By upgrading to Precision's Performance Ignition Kit, spark quality can be restored and lost power regained, often with the additional power beyond what other coils provide. No software tune is required for installation or operation, but if desired, coil output can be increased to 118mJ from most software tuning companies!"

Colder spark plugs work by pulling more heat out of the engine's cylinders (making them ""colder"") and dissipating it into the engine's head, which is then cooled by the cooling system. Depending on how you have your engine built, these could be a great addition! Colder plugs can help prevent engine knock and prevent the tip of the spark plug from melting or misfiring. There are two rules that most people tend to go by when deciding on which spark plugs to buy: The first rule of thumb is that with every 100 horsepower added, you should run spark plugs that are a step colder than your stock plugs. This is generally accepted across the motorsports community but unfortunately isn't always the most accurate measurement of when you will need colder plugs. The second rule is to go a step colder any time you massively alter cylinder temperatures by adding forced induction to an NA engine, by increasing compression ratio, after altering timing in a major way, or by changing fuel types to something with a higher octane rating such as racing fuel. Adding spark plugs that are a step colder outside of these conditions, with no real change to the engine, can actually hurt more than help by leading to spark plugs fouling quicker than normal and by making the car harder to start in cold weather conditions. We suggest talking to your engine builder or tuner before making the change, or you can call our Turner Motorsport sales staff to discuss what modifications have been made to your vehicle and see if these plugs are right for you!"

With a faulty coil the spark plug is not burning the air/fuel mixture properly and that can lead to problems anywhere in the engine and exhaust (including catalytic converters and O2 sensors). Problems with one or more coils will cause a fault code but not always a check engine light. A misfire code may be related to an ignition coil but could be from other things as well.

You can also move coils around to different cylinder banks to see if the misfire code follows a suspect coil.

Brisk Racing offers a great performance spark plug that gives you a more intense spark without sacrificing OEM reliability. The combination of a center electrode with Iridium contact and ground electrode from Yttrium alloy with copper core cut to spark plug center decreases demand for voltage, it opens the spark gap into the combustion chamber and significantly suppresses flame extinguishing effect at cold starts. In so doing the spark plugs change interval 65,000 miles is maintained. The material used to the spark plugs has a major impact on lifetime and functional properties. While precious metals such as Platinum and Iridium are very resistant to wear but have a considerable demand for high voltage generated by the ignition system. The combination of Iridium center electrode and ground electrodes of special design with Yttrium alloy which is based on Nickel is an ideal solution for maintaining lifetime and spark plug performance improvements. The requirement for power generated by the ignition system is also influenced by the geometric shape of the spark gap. Optimal combination of the spark gap and the reduced demand for form by appropriate choice of electrode material effect synergic on the improvement of spark plug performance.

Precision Raceworks' ignition kit is designed to fit any vehicle with an N55 engine and offers the highest output of any kit on the market! Featuring 100% Plug-&-Play connections, low resistance 50ohm/ft proprietary plug wires, and design technology from Marine and Aerospace applications, these coils are guaranteed to output consistent high voltage and current for optimal ignition system performance and reliability. Every component in this kit meets or exceeds OEM quality and features premium seals for dust and water resistance. While coils do not directly increase horsepower, stock BMW coils can wear out quickly, resulting in underperforming voltage and current output. This often leads to weaker spark intensity and reduced power output. Due to the increased voltage and current output, many customers have seen as much as 20+ whp/wtq gained by switching to Precision Raceworks coils over all other coils on the market! By upgrading to Precision's Performance Ignition Kit, spark quality can be restored, and lost power regained often with the additional power beyond what other coils provide. No software tune is required for installation or operation, but if desired, coil output can be increased to 118mJ from most software tuning companies!"

With a faulty coil the spark plug is not burning the air/fuel mixture properly and that can lead to problems anywhere in the engine and exhaust (including catalytic converters and O2 sensors). Problems with one or more coils will cause a fault code but not always a check engine light. A misfire code may be related to an ignition coil but could be from other things as well. Sometimes a visual inspection of a coil and coil boot will give an indication of a failure. You can also move coils around to different cylinder banks to see if the misfire code follows a suspect coil. We suggest always having one or two coils on hand to keep as spares.   Sold per coil.
