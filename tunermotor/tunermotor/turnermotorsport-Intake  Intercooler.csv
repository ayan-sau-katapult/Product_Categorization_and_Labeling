However, air density is just as important as air volume. Cooler air is denser air, so in addition to keeping your engine cool, it's important to make sure that your intake charge is as cool as possible. Turner Motorsport's upgraded intercooler works to reduce air temperatures with a bare minimum of pressure drop. Less pressure drop means less restriction, and a turbocharger that doesn't have to work as hard. This results not only in a longer service life for your turbocharger, but a substantial increase in performance as well."

In our eyes, the best intercooler upgrade is one that not only works but also installs with a minimum amount of fuss.   Compared to the stock OEM intercooler:     One of the best features of this kit is how easy it is to install (the easiest we have used to date). It's a direct bolt-on replacement for your stock intercooler - no removing the bumper or modifying brackets or wrestling with plumbing. Core size measures 20.5""x5.1""x8.25"". Wagner has also engineered their end-tanks in aluminum instead of the factory plastic, which is much more durable over the long term.

The stock air-water intercooler is quickly overcome with heat and can't keep the intake air cool enough. If it's too hot the engine computer will reduce power to safer levels. This Dinan intercooler is a larger version of the stock intercooler. A larger core = more surface area and a larger capacity for heat dissipation. Each Dinan intercooler is 23% larger than the stock unit. Even heat soak at low speeds is reduced, making this a worthwhile addition even for stock or mildly tuned engines. This kit comes complete with silicone hoses, coolant lines, and installation hardware. Professional installation recommended but detailed installation instructions are included."

The CP-E FMIC is a direct fit replacement for the stock intercooler, mounting in the same location, and with only minimal trimming for a factory-like fitment. During dyno testing, CP-E measured an hugely impressive 84% efficiency with 14lbs of boost (compared to 64% for the factory intercooler) as well as improved pressure losses. This is the best engineered and impressively designed N54 intercooler kit we have seen to date.   CP-E designed an intercooler upgrade from scratch and backed up with sound engineering and scientific data collection. Their IC kit was developed on their dyno with a data logging system using eight temperature and pressure sensors to accurately gauge the performance of the stock intercooler and come up with a game plan on improving upon it. They found the stock system worked adequately for the stock boost levels but was quickly overwhelmed when the engine was modified for more boost (heat). There are two important metrics when assessing the performance of an intercooler: efficiency (how well does the IC extract heat from the intake air) and pressure loss (how much boost pressure is lost from passing through the IC). CP-E measured 64% efficiency with over 3 bar of lost pressure at 6,300 RPM with the stock IC.   The typical plan for a better intercooler is to use the biggest core that will fit within the bodywork. While scoring good efficiency numbers the larger surface area will have greater pressure loss. It's the hidden catch to the ""bigger is better"" intercooler kits on the market. The best IC kits will walk a fine line on thermal efficiency from more surface area with preserving the boost output from the turbos. If you can retain as much of the turbo boost as possible you will ultimately put out more power (you can do as much or more with less). CP-E engineered their FMIC kit along these principles and the results are very impressive for such a compact design.   Their new IC design proved to be superior when they measured 84% efficiency and less than 2 bar of pressure loss at 6,300 RPM! That's a 20% improvement in efficiency and over a pound of pressure gained back over the stock intercooler! While the stock IC decreased intake air temp by 120 degrees, the CP-E IC dropped it by nearly 180 degrees. The CP-E IC has a distinct advantage over the stock IC at all RPM but especially so after 4,500 RPM where the stock unit just can't withstand the heat and its performance quickly plummets. The CP-E IC is much more stable across the RPM band. On the dyno, the 335i with the CP-E IC put down almost 20whp more than the stock IC setup. This N54 intercooler kit really delivers as promised.   The CP-E N54 FMIC is made from a bar and plate design with a core measuring 21""x5.5""x6.0"". The end tanks are CAD designed for optimized flow and then cast in aluminum. The factory oil cooler is relocated above the intercooler for better airflow. New silicone and aluminum inlet and outlet pipes with clamps are included. For the E60 535 the installation is straightforward but will require permanent cutting of plastic shrouds to get a perfect fit.   Made in the USA.     2006-2010    535i 535xi 535i xDrive"

The Evolution of Speed intercooler core was spec'd by an engineering firm which specializes in heat exchanger design and is rated to 900hp+...far beyond the rating of the factory intercooler. The intercooler picked up 7whp and15wtq on EOS's own completely stock 2017 F80 ZCP."

The stock intercooler design is commendable for single runs at the stock boost levels, but add any more boost and the system is quickly overwhelmed. As the ECU corrects for heat soak, the boost will be decreased and power reduced. Installing an upgraded intercooler is essential to keeping the engine computer from restraining boost as temperatures climb and helps to maintain boost levels even in the face of elevated turbocharger temperatures. The Evolution Racewerks Competition intercooler is much larger than stock, providing more surface area for cooling air to pass through. Even heat soak at low speeds is reduced, making this a worthwhile addition even for stock or mildly tuned engines."

So the cooling of the charged air is not realized by the ambient air as a cooling medium (as usual), but made with its own cooling water circuit. A reduction of the temperature of the cooling water is directly equated with an improved cooling performance of the charged air. This is exactly where the advantages of the WAGNERTUNING upgrade radiator comes into play. The newly developed competition racing core of the WAGNERTUNING high-performance radiator increase the radiator volume of the OEM water cooler by a total of 117 %. The calculated ratio between the inner and outer cooling surface generates a maximum heat transfer and allows at the same time enough airflow for the surrounding components (for example the engine radiator) for its own heat exchange. Furthermore, using an increased amount of cooling water, the entire system thermics can be kept at a lower level over a longer period of time. All WAGNERTUNING radiators are equipped with a heat-conductive anti-corrosion coating to ensure a lasting cooling effect. The plug & play installation of the system is simple and easy to perform (an installation instruction is included as well).
