BMW called them ""lifetime"" but there's no question that any filter is going to get saturated with debris and dirt and its performance will suffer. The dirty filter can cause E90/E92 running issues like stalling, poor performance, rough running, chugging. We have replaced these filters in cars with 130,000+ miles and found the original filter was long overdue for replacement. These cars had the above driveability problems but had no fault codes or DTCs (which led to other shops making poor service recommendations). So we recommend having this done at the 80-100,000 mile mark as a scheduled maintenance item. There's no harm or downside to replacing it before it's completely clogged and your engine starts to suffer.   The fuel filter is located on the driver's side and includes two new large o-rings for the lock rings. The crossover lines to the fuel pump on the passenger side are included as well. We recommend new steel lock rings for the filter and the pump, especially on cars located in the Rust Belt or in salty climates. On really high mileage cars it would be a good idea to also replace the fuel pump as preventative maintenance since the job is essentially the same. The E9X fuel filter replacement is not complex but access can be difficult and you're dealing with potentially fragile plastic so amateurs may want to leave this to a professional technician.   When doing any sort of repair or maintenance there is no replacement for genuine factory parts. Turner Motorsport carries the Genuine BMW brand with pride and has the parts you need to complete your next project with confidence.   Not for N51 SULEV engines in 128i/328i/328xi.
