     ...",1316809,601-0005,$79.99,"Precision Raceworks' Fuel Injector Removal and Installation Tool is one of the highest-rated tools on the market, not only for removal and installation of injectors but also for the installation and compression of the high-pressure seals! For injector removal, simply thread the tool onto the input of the fuel injector and use the slide hammer to tap the injector out. When installing new seals, simply use needle-nose pliers to pinch the old seal and remove it. Once removed, the new seal can be installed using the included expansion tool found stored inside the shaft of the tool. The rest is as easy as 1, 2, 3! Insert the injector into die #1 and count to 10, then insert the injector into die #2 and count to 20, finally insert the injector into die #3 and count to 30, then install your injector."

This handy tool is toothed to match the lock ring and takes a standard 1/2 drive ratchet or small extension. Twist the ratchet and the lock ring comes un-done cleanly and smoothly. A hefty tool that pays for itself over and over. Fits most BMWs from 1988-2013. Also has application for MINI and Porsche."
