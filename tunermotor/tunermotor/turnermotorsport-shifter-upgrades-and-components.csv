These precision machined bushings replace the original flimsy rubber bushing (which degrades over time) at the front of the aluminum carrier. UUC tried harder rubber and urethane but found them to be substandard and continued to allow the carrier to flex. Because of the tight tolerances of a computer-controlled milling machine, tolerances can be held to 0.001"" (about the width of a human hair) to ensure a perfect fit. UUC uses only high quality, medical-grade, Teflon impregnated, heat resistant Delrin for their bushings. Sure, it's more expensive and overkill, but to us, using only the best makes the best product.

Is it also sloppy, and slipping to the side?   Quite simply, it is well-known that BMW's original clutch arm bushings are the culprit for these annoying problems. You can lubricate, replace, curse, even murmur obscure voodoo prayers - but none of that will work.      By simply replacing the stock bushings with the UHMW (Ultra High Molecular Weight polycetal) UUC Motorwerks Clutch Arm Bushings, you can permanently get rid of that annoying squeak and the side-slop.   The great advantage of UHMW over other materials is the superior long-term wear characteristics and self-lubricating properties.

Whether you have a factory stock shifter or aftermarket short shift kit, this Dual Shear Selector Rod (DSSR) will dramatically improve it.     While producing a ""short"" shifter, our more important goal in improving the BMW shifter assembly is to increase the precision and smoothness of the overall operation.     One significant wear area that has never been addressed previously is the     In the original BMW design, the connection at both ends has a large injection-molded plastic bushing. We already know how badly plastic wears in an automotive application, and these areas are not an exception. The design of the selector rod has a pin at 90� to the main rod, which exerts a tremendous amount of leveraged force on the selector joint bushing from one side (known as a    force). The result is a steady deformation of the bushing, resulting in looseness and slop in the entire mechanism. (see photo at right) The image shows a selector joint that has approximately 25K miles of use.   The looseness and slop are magnified by the leverage-multiplication effect of the shift lever itself. The result is an in-gear shifter ""free play"" of 3/4"" and up to 1"" in either direction, over 35mm total.     A temporary fix is to simply replace the selector joint. Unfortunately, this is only a temporary fix as the new joint's bushing will exhibit the same rapid deformation. To permanently fix this, a change in the fundamental design of the pivot is required, changing the assembly to a    system with the   .   The DSSR redistributes the torsional forces from the pin/bushing interface to the complete face area on both sides of the selector joint. By taking advantage of the strength of steel in the DSSR and the body of the joint, the problem of deformation is eliminated and the movement of the selector rod correlates directly to movement of the selector joint - the only ""free play"" movement remaining in the shifter assembly is from within the transmission itself.

Whether you have a factory stock shifter or aftermarket short shift kit, this Dual Shear Selector Rod (DSSR) will dramatically improve it.     While producing a ""short"" shifter, our more important goal in improving the BMW shifter assembly is to increase the precision and smoothness of the overall operation.     One significant wear area that has never been addressed previously is the     In the original BMW design, the connection at both ends has a large injection-molded plastic bushing. We already know how badly plastic wears in an automotive application, and these areas are not an exception. The design of the selector rod has a pin at 90 to the main rod, which exerts a tremendous amount of leveraged force on the selector joint bushing from one side (known as a    force). The result is a steady deformation of the bushing, resulting in looseness and slop in the entire mechanism. (see photo at right) The image shows a selector joint that has approximately 25K miles of use.   The looseness and slop are magnified by the leverage-multiplication effect of the shift lever itself. The result is an in-gear shifter ""free play"" of 3/4"" and up to 1"" in either direction, over 35mm total.     A temporary fix is to simply replace the selector joint. Unfortunately, this is only a temporary fix as the new joint's bushing will exhibit the same rapid deformation. To permanently fix this, a change in the fundamental design of the pivot is required, changing the assembly to a    system with the   .   The DSSR redistributes the torsional forces from the pin/bushing interface to the complete face area on both sides of the selector joint. By taking advantage of the strength of steel in the DSSR and the body of the joint, the problem of deformation is eliminated and the movement of the selector rod correlates directly to movement of the selector joint - the only ""free play"" movement remaining in the shifter assembly is from within the transmission itself.     The original BMW shifter and all other aftermarket shifters (except UUC which uses deformation-free bearings) contain a plastic bushing similar to the selector joint, and the exact same wear and ovalization causes those shifters to get sloppy. The DSSR permanently fixes these shifters also.    When used with the original BMW shifter or other aftermarket shifters, the amount of ""free play"" will be greatly reduced but varies by shifter (flexation of the shifter shaft contributes to the total ""free play"" travel).   This selector rod fits 1992-1994 E36 325i/is/ic and 1995 M3 produced before 9/1994. UUC also recommends this for an E30 with a M50/M52/S50/S52   .

This kit does not include a carrier or selector rod.* One of the most satisfying upgrades you can make to your BMW is to its factory shifter mechanism. By reducing the shifter's throw, you can give your manual transmission BMW a sportier, more precise feel. However, with so many different ""short shift kits"" out there, how can you be sure you're making the right decision? With the introduction of the Rogue Engineering OCTANE short shift kit, the choice is now crystal clear! Rogue Engineering refuses to compromise with ""lever substitution"" as a method of short shift kit development. Rather than using actual test vehicles for their products, some companies actually dig through OEM factory parts diagrams to determine which factory levers can be substituted with others. This ""lever substitution"" method of introducing product is unacceptable. These shift kits have been developed and perfected through years of experience in proven short shifter technology, by Co-Founder, Ben Liaw. As longtime BMW enthusiasts know, Ben was single-handedly responsible for introducing and developing the idea of affordable, BMW factory-like, short shift kits for late model BMWs (BL/SS for those young enough to remember!). Rogue Engineering idea of a short shift kit is not substituting levers in place of factory ones just because ""they fit"". Throughout the 80s until recently, BMW was notorious for using only a few specific shifter levers for their manual transmission vehicles. For other companies, making just a few ""replacement levers"" and offering them in place of those factory part numbers was an easy way of calling it a short shift kit. Unfortunately, for those companies, BMW started using many different part numbers making it more difficult to just ""swap in a lever"". Rogue Engineering only develops it's short shift kit with test vehicles in their facility, testing numerous prototypes, offering others to test it before settling on its final design. They feel that this old school, real world testing is the best way when modifying OEM ergonomic, sensory-based controls."

Some of that play comes from the bushings where the shifter carrier mounts to the transmission. The original rubber carrier bushings don't last very long and when they get too soft the shifter flops around. These Delrin bushings have almost no deflection and will last much longer than the factory rubber, giving you precise shifting for many years."

Why the rally lever extension? Having the added height allows you to keep both hands closer to the wheel through shifts - this is especially helpful on the track, but we like it in our daily drivers too."

It's all too easy to put your BMW into the wrong gear and over-rev the engine, resulting in the infamous mis-shift (or money$hift). Short shift kits are not the solution - effort and notchiness go up but it's still easy to grab the wrong gear. The CAE shifter IS the answer, however.The CAE shift kit is the real deal as far as motorsport shift levers is concerned. It's function over form. The real engineering is inside the shifter housing. A spring pre-loads the shift linkage so shifts are much faster. There is no slop or play in the shift lever and the shift gate is much smaller than the factory setup so there's no wasted motion. Even the best BMW short shift kits will feel vague and sloppy after trying the CAE. Over-engineered? Nope it's just the German way. Check out the CAE shifter's long list of attributes -"

Whether you have a factory stock shifter or aftermarket short shift kit, this Dual Shear Selector Rod (DSSR) will dramatically improve it.     While producing a ""short"" shifter, our more important goal in improving the BMW shifter assembly is to increase the precision and smoothness of the overall operation.     One significant wear area that has never been addressed previously is the     In the original BMW design, the connection at both ends has a large injection-molded plastic bushing. We already know how badly plastic wears in an automotive application, and these areas are not an exception. The design of the selector rod has a pin at 90� to the main rod, which exerts a tremendous amount of leveraged force on the selector joint bushing from one side (known as a    force). The result is a steady deformation of the bushing, resulting in looseness and slop in the entire mechanism. (see photo at right) The image shows a selector joint that has approximately 25K miles of use.   The looseness and slop are magnified by the leverage-multiplication effect of the shift lever itself. The result is an in-gear shifter ""free play"" of 3/4"" and up to 1"" in either direction, over 35mm total.     A temporary fix is to simply replace the selector joint. Unfortunately, this is only a temporary fix as the new joint's bushing will exhibit the same rapid deformation. To permanently fix this, a change in the fundamental design of the pivot is required, changing the assembly to a    system with the   .   The DSSR redistributes the torsional forces from the pin/bushing interface to the complete face area on both sides of the selector joint. By taking advantage of the strength of steel in the DSSR and the body of the joint, the problem of deformation is eliminated and the movement of the selector rod correlates directly to movement of the selector joint - the only ""free play"" movement remaining in the shifter assembly is from within the transmission itself.     The original BMW shifter and all other aftermarket shifters (except UUC which uses deformation-free bearings) contain a plastic bushing similar to the selector joint, and the exact same wear and ovalization causes those shifters to get sloppy. The DSSR permanently fixes these shifters also.    When used with the original BMW shifter or other aftermarket shifters, the amount of ""free play"" will be greatly reduced but varies by shifter (flexation of the shifter shaft contributes to the total ""free play"" travel).   This rod fits all E36 3 Series (1995-1999) with the 5 speed manual transmission - including 323, 325, 328, and M3 with 9/1994 and later production dates."
