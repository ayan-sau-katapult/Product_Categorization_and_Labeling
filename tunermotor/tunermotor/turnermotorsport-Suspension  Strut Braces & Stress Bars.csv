This design is stronger than most strut braces that use a hinge on the end that allows additonal flex. This design has fixed end mounts that the strut bar is bolted to. The slim oval tube is 100% carbon fiber for excellent strength and rigidty. The entire assembly is less than 5lbs and installs in minutes."
