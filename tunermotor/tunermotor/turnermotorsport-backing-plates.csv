Our rack stops will help protect your investment. Rack stops are spacers that install inside of the tie rod and limits the amount of steering travel. You can save the costs of replacing rubbing tires, worn out brake ducts, cut shock reservoir hoses, and broken underside plastic panels. There is also the added benefit of knowing you can turn the steering wheel to full lock and not be worried that the wheels will rub. Our rack stop length is the approximate length that will be removed from the outside tire wall�s path. For example, if a 16mm rack stop is used, there will be 16mm more clearance for a brake duct between the fender well and the edge of the tire. Included with this kit: 2 Delrin rack stops, 1 black (driver�s side), 1 white (passenger�s side), 2 Locking plates (only needed on E36), 4 zip ties, detailed instructions."

Hi-Flow Molded ABS Cooling Ductwork: The HARD Motorsport Brake Cooling DUCT kit is designed for maximum efficiency specifically for the BMW E36. Race-inspired by modern duct design of top motorsport teams and manufacturers. Easy Mounting / Removable Front Bumper: Because the ducts are supported by the frame rail, you can remove your entire front bumper without the need of disconnecting ANY part of your brake cooling system. No need to fumble with bolts, screws, and duct clamps, or unintentionally ripping out your flex tubing in the process. No need for extra inlets: The kit provides all that you need for mounting brake cooling ducts directly to factory mounting points on the frame rail of your BMW E36 M3. These ducts draw cold air directly from the design of the bumper. Our quality ABS plastic molded ducts are designed to endure the rigors of racing. Durable and easy to manage. No need for all that flex hose: While our kit reduces the area of interference, space is limited, so contact may still occur at full lock.** However, our kit uses a fraction of the length of flex tube over any other kit, so replacing this short hose is much easier on a budget and is a time saver in the paddock. Features: Left and Right contour-molded ABS chamber ducts/inlets Left and Right HARD aluminum mounting brackets/abrasion plate (2) high temp. 3"" flex hose (4) stainless steel hose clamps"

Our unique design specifically for the E46 and Z4 (not M) is optimized for 3"" hose and allows the air to flow directly to the rotor with no impedance or obstruction, and with a considerably lower weight than competing products. When flow tested compared to a competitors product, the Turner brake ducts flowed twice as much! This greatly reduces the chance of brake fade, boiling the brake fluid, and wear and tear on your brake components. Installation is easy, as it does not require removal of the wheel bearing, by making the backing plate in two parts. The main backing plate and a block off plate that bolts together. Most companies just have a big slot so you can slide the backing plate on, but then it just lets air flow right out the back end. Since we seal off the entire center hub of the rotor, we can maximize cooling airflow to the center of the rotor.        1999-2006    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 328i 328ci 330i 330ci M3  2003-2008    Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si"

Our brake cooling kit is complete - scooping air from the front bumper, through silicone hose, and to the brake rotor hub via backing plates. The front ducts and backing plates are made from 100% carbon fiber for light weight and strength.   These carefully designed spoiler ducts are shaped like an ""accumulator box"" - scooping the air as it flows around the bumper. Because we make this from carbon fiber we were able to refine the shape and fitment to maximize the airflow, as well as engineer these to be very light weight and use a minimal amount of hose. They can also be custom trimmed to fit a variety of E46 bumpers and configurations. Because this duct was designed for all-out racecars, removal of the factory washer bottle is required.   The hose we use is a high-strength, 3"" silicone hose, and strengthened with wire. High-quality hose clamps are included to attach to the bumper ducts and backing plates.   The carbon backing plates are one of our best sellers. These backing plates fit easily onto the back of the rotor without removal of the hub / wheel bearing. The 3"" inlet is smooth and unobstructed, allowing as much air into the rotor hub as possible. And since these are made from carbon fiber they are light weight and will not attract/retain heat.     2001-2006    M3  1999-2006    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi,    These will not work with any other non-M stock bumper."

Similar to the brake air ducts found on the factory GT4 race car, it's designed to mount directly onto the front bumper. Dry carbon fiber's name comes from its manufacturing process. Dry carbon fiber is formed by using a ""pre-preg"" or impregnated piece of carbon materials. This piece of carbon is first placed into a mold, and then into a sealed autoclave to properly cure. This particular method creates the least amount of waste and forms a lighter version of carbon than the “wet” method. The autoclave vacuuming process of making dry carbon means that there are fewer pinholes and virtually no air pockets that form in the carbon. Dry carbon is the highest-quality version of carbon fiber products that are produced. Note: Modification is required to the bumper prior to installation."
