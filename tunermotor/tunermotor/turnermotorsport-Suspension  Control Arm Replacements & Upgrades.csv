While rubber and urethane bushings flex during load, the toe can change widely giving you nervous and unpredictable handling. These RTABs have a solid aluminum housing with a high-quality sealed OE bearing. These bushings were developed from years of competition use in various racing and HPDE events. There is simply no better RTAB unless your racing class rules prohibit the use of mono or spherical bearings.The rear trailing arm bushings take a lot of abuse from acclerating, braking and cornering. The stock rubber bushings are just not up to the task of keeping rear wheel alignment in spec for very long, especially if you have upgraded to stickier tires and a better suspension. The pliable rubber flexes and twists which slows down reaction time and leaves you with a car that feels nervous and 'tail happy'. Urethane helps to control the alignment but issues with fitment, maintenance, and longevity keep us from recommending urethane on anything but a street car. We also offer a Delrin RTAB for cars that must conform to certain racing class rules. These sealed spherical bearings are the best at controlling rear toe alignment.Our aluminum RTABs are very well made - high grade aluminum alloy and steel CNC'd out of a billet by an ISO 9001 certified manufacturer, each component is either hardcoated or nickel plated. While multiple manufacturers offer two piece designs, our research showed that a one piece bushing is a better design featuring a sealed bearing to keep contaminants out extending the life of the bearing."

Tasked with keeping suspension geometry in check while absorbing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) factory rubber bushings were engineered to provide a balance of comfort and control.

This is typically felt by a sudden jerk forward after the car comes to a stop and is a leading cause of ""sloppy"" or ""loose"" suspension feel. By replacing the bushing with a full polyurethane unit or using a bushing insert, this play is eliminated since the suspension joint is being supported by a much stiffer material that will not harden or shrink over time. Additionally, the inherent stiffness of the urethane material translates body forces much more directly. This means steering inputs from the driver are effectively transferred to the wheels and vital road information is transmitted properly from the wheels to the driver."

Under normal driving conditions with a stock, fresh suspension it is unlikely that you will ever have a problem. But with an upgraded street or race suspension with firm springs much of the energy from pounding the road is transmitted to the thin sheet metal in the strut tower. This pounding will cause the tower to deform or even crack. Look for 'mushrooming' or deformity around the holes for the three mounting studs at the top of the strut tower. The sheetmetal around the holes should really be flat and square. Poor shocks or stiff suspensions will actually cause this sheetmetal to pop up.   These factory BMW reinforcement plates will help disperse the energy and save you from costly repairs in the future. A strut brace also helps to prevent this but these plates are designed to reinforce the strut tower from the bottom.

Tasked with keeping suspension geometry in check while absorbing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) factory rubber bushings were engineered to provide a balance of comfort and control. As a factory bushing ages, it becomes brittle and begins to harden. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow excess play in the suspension joint. This is typically felt by a sudden jerk forward after the car comes to a stop and is a leading cause of ""sloppy"" or ""loose"" suspension feel. By replacing the bushing with a full polyurethane unit or using a bushing insert, this play is eliminated since the suspension joint is being supported by a much stiffer material that will not harden or shrink over time. Additionally, the inherent stiffness of the urethane material translates body forces much more directly. This means steering inputs from the driver are effectively transferred to the wheels and vital road information is transmitted properly from the wheels to the driver."

They are constantly in motion and take abuse from impacts, potholes, rough roads, and general cornering/wheel motions. To give a quiet and smooth ride, the bushings are made of compliant rubber. But the rubber can only withstand so much abuse before they become loose and spongy. This results in vibrations and possibly a shimmy when driving. A visual inspection will usually confirm that there is too much flex in the rubber or the rubber has cracked and torn. And if you're installing new control arms, always install new bushings to avoid duplicating labor costs."

You get sloppy steering, vibrations, and poor handling which makes the car feel unstable. These urethane bushings are stiffer than stock rubber and will not deflect as much. This helps keep the alignment in check with less variation. The car feels more planted and confidence-inspiring. And a lifetime warranty means you'll likely never have to pay for another bushing ever again! Powerflex polyurethane subframe bushings are firmer than OEM bushings, resulting in better handling, a more planted rear-end, and more efficient suspension articulation - all with minimal sacrifice to ride quality. Powerflex is the number one selling suspension bushing manufacturer in Europe. Their experience with polyurethane bushing material and state-of-the art manufacturing techniques allows them to produce premium performance bushings, made to exact-fit standards. Powerflex performance polyurethane bushings are built to last longer than OEM rubber bushings, while improving performance and allowing for a more engaging driving experience. Use of Powerflex Copper Grease PCG1 is recommended for ease of installation. Periodic reapplication is recommended to extend squeak-free service life of bushings. Powerflex street bushings are ideal for street driven vehicles and those that see occasional autocross or track time. Need bushings for a dedicated track car? Powerflex Black Series bushings are the ultimate in track and race bushings. Featuring 95A durometer polyurethane, Black Series bushings are 25% stiffer than street bushings.

Tasked with keeping suspension geometry in check while absorbing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) factory rubber bushings were engineered to provide a balance of comfort and control. As a factory bushing ages, it becomes brittle and begins to harden. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow excess play in the suspension joint. This is typically felt by a sudden jerk forward after the car comes to a stop and is a leading cause of ""sloppy"" or ""loose"" suspension feel. By replacing the bushing with a full polyurethane unit or using a bushing insert, this play is eliminated since the suspension joint is being supported by a much stiffer material that will not harden or shrink over time. Additionally, the inherent stiffness of the urethane material translates body forces much more directly. This means steering inputs from the driver are effectively transferred to the wheels and vital road information is transmitted properly from the wheels to the driver."

Not only will you get more life from your RTAB but these will help stiffen the bushing during cornering. But during normal driving you will still have all of the comfort of the stock rubber bushings.

The front suspension ball joints in particular are prone to wearing out quite quickly thanks to a soft material in the ball joint itself, leaving you in a potentially dangerous situation. At best, worn ball joints and bushings will give you poor steering feedback and clunking noises. However, loose or worn ball joints will have excessive play which will drastically reduce the effectiveness of the steering and suspension. In extreme cases, the ball joint has been known to pop free of the control arm, resulting in total steering loss.Meyle has addressed this problem with a higher-grade metal in their HD ball joints, similar to those used on the E36 M3. The metal will not wear or fatigue nearly as fast as the standard ball joints. The lifespan is greatly extended. A side benefit of the stiffer joint is better steering response. The metal will not flex or deflect like plastic, rubber, or any other material. The lack of play will mean sharper steering, restoring much of the car's precision and fun-to-drive character. Meyle is a German brand in business since 1958 and all of their products are TUV approved and meet or exceed ISO standards.We supply the Meyle HD control arms as a set with new M3 rubber control arm bushings. You can choose bushings with either a centered hole (same as stock original) or with an offset hole (adds caster and camber). The stock rubber bushings (manufactured by Boge) will be perfect for most people but if you're looking for an upgrade, the offset bushings will give the car quicker steering response. The solid rubber mounts last longer and give better feedback than the original web design.All Meyle HD parts come with a 4-year, unlimited mileage warranty."

Though failure prone, even factory-fresh OEM rubber bushings allow for deflection, causing suspension geometry changes on hard launches, over bumps in the road, and during cornering. This deflection results in clunking in the rear end, a “rear steer” feeling, and uneven tire wear.Powerflex polyurethane rear trailing arm bushings are firmer than OEM bushings, resulting in a reduction of deflection that causes these suspension angle changes, improving handling over bumps and with a proper alignment, extending tire wear."

The stock rear camber arm/wishbone is designed to be flexible and weak. In an impact, it's designed to bend or even break to absorb energy and prevent damage to other more vital components. This is great on a regular street car. But on a track car, or heavily modified street car, these arms can bend just from cornering forces and that can introduce radical camber changes that will throw off the balance and handling of the car. This reinforcement solves all of that by tying the two sections of the arm together. This creates a single solid arm with minimal flex in the arm itself. We can't take credit for this innovation - BMW recognized the problem and did this on their factory Group N racecars.

We also recommend replacing the bushings when changing the control arms. The bushings are mounted at the back of the control arm and located the arm to the frame rail on the car. The stock bushings are rubber and will wear out sooner than the control arms themselves. With the control arm off the car now is the perfect time to also replace the bushings.     1987-1991    325ix"

When it comes to control arms on the track, making them as stiff as you can (usually using solid mounts) is the best way to increase your driving precision by eliminating the deflection of rubber. The next best thing to create a balance would be to stiffen up the control arm with polyurethane, giving you the option of a more stock like feel with 80a or closer to the solid feel with 95a durometers. These poly bushings will give your control arms a direct connection between your suspension and the body of the car eliminating the slop felt under take-off and braking so you feel more in control of your vehicle."

When the fluid is gone the rubber left over cannot match the original bushing's strength. The left over rubber is not stiff enough to resist the movements from the suspension. The result is a lot of vibration and reduced feedback and response from the steering.Meyle has addressed this issue with bushings that are not fluid-filled. The bushing is made of solid rubber that will last longer than the original bushing and is a bit stiffer than new originals for better response and feel. The lack of play from the solid rubber design will mean sharper steering, restoring much of the car's precision and 'connected' feel.This control arm comes with the Meyle HD bushings already pressed in. This makes for an easy swap out-swap in install. These arms replace the existing stock upper control arms - otherwise known as a tension strut or strut support arm.

This helps keep the alignment in check with less variation. The car feels more planted and confidence-inspiring. And a lifetime warranty means you'll likely never have to pay for another bushing ever again! Powerflex polyurethane subframe bushings are firmer than OEM bushings, resulting in better handling, a more planted rear-end, and more efficient suspension articulation - all with minimal sacrifice to ride quality. Powerflex is the number one selling suspension bushing manufacturer in Europe. Their experience with polyurethane bushing material and state-of-the art manufacturing techniques allows them to produce premium performance bushings, made to exact-fit standards. Powerflex performance polyurethane bushings are built to last longer than OEM rubber bushings, while improving performance and allowing for a more engaging driving experience. Use of Powerflex Copper Grease PCG1 is recommended for ease of installation. Periodic reapplication is recommended to extend squeak-free service life of bushings. Powerflex street bushings are ideal for street driven vehicles and those that see occasional autocross or track time. Need bushings for a dedicated track car? Powerflex Black Series bushings are the ultimate in track and race bushings. Featuring 95A durometer polyurethane, Black Series bushings are 25% stiffer than street bushings.

As these cars age, they require a number of suspension bushings to be replaced. Bushing replacement not only keeps the car in its top form, it also makes the car safer. Depending on the work, it may be logical to replace all of the bushings in the rear suspension (there are 19 total). This is especially true if you are pulling the subframe out to do the floor reinforcement or if you're doing a diff install. Turner Motorsport is a big believer in using rubber bushings for street cars (with the exception of solid subframe mounts, see further below). Urethanes, Delrin, or aluminum are generally good for reducing compliance and limiting deflection - attributes that don't really work well on roads filled with potholes, railroad crossings, cracks, and expansion joints. The rubber bushings maintain the factory ride/handling traits that won the E36 praise all over the world. Every bushing will need maintenance or replacement at some point and rubber has proven to last the longest and need less maintenance than anything else, even urethane. And unless competitive driving is your goal, the harder materials are only a gimmick."

To give a quiet and smooth ride, the bushings are made of compliant rubber. But the rubber can only withstand so much abuse before they become loose and spongy. This results in vibrations and possibly a shimmy when driving. A visual inspection will usually confirm that there is too much flex in the rubber or the rubber has cracked and torn.

This package bundles the Turner Monoball upper thrust arms with the stock M3 lower control arms. If there's one big fail point in the E82/E9X front suspension it's the thrust arms. The front inner thrust arm bushing is filled with dampening fluid that leaks over time. Once it's gone the bushing has the strength of a rubber band. Even though we sell two types of upgraded rubber bushings there was still room for improvement. For someone looking for superior performance and longevity these sealed monoball bushings are the best out there.

To makes this an easier process, we are proud to introduce our Turner Motorsport Front Control Arm Monoball Upgrade kit! Our experience with spherical front control arm ball joints go back to those we designed and used in our IMSA E90 328i and E92 M3 racecars (GS class Champions in 2011). We wanted to offer e30, e36, and e46 owners similar levels of handling precision and control for the track and street, but weren’t satisfied with the other options out there. Instead of a Delrin® bushing or unsealed spherical bearing alone, we selected an oversized sealed greaseable spherical monoball to offer unparalleled durability and precision, but designed a Delrin® adapter sleeve to help isolate the added noise, vibration, and harshness that a full solid monoball bearing will have. While race-ready, our hybrid Delrin®/monoball control arm bearings are more at home on the street than other kits that are advertised as “race-only” bearings. We did extensive street, autocross, and track testing to ensure the spherical bearing used in this bushing design excelled in each setting. The stock rubber bushings, even those found in the M3, allow significant fore/aft movement of the front wheels to help absorb road impacts, especially when being pushed hard. This soft flexible design maximizes daily driving comfort, but also allows considerable alignment change. This unwanted deflection stands between you and a crisp, confidence-inspiring driving experience. The advantage of a monoball bearing is that it will not deflect under load, eliminating all unwanted deflection while still allowing complete freedom of movement in the desired angles. What you get is superior steering precision with better handling from more consistent alignment and direct braking feedback, with exceptional service life. Thanks to the Delrin® insert and double lip seals, there's none of the extra noise or reduced service life often found on other spherical bearings. In short, if you're seeking front control arm bushings that offer precise, predictable handling, crisper braking feel, with a long service life free from noise - look no further. We have you covered. Watch to learn more about Turner Monoball Bushing Bearing Extremely robust, greaseable, double lip sealed spherical bearing (Rated for 20,000lbf Dynamic, 90,000lbf Static). Housing 6061-T6, anodized bearing housing with needle grease zerk for easy maintenance. In house designed knurled OD to provide the perfect fit for the wide range of housing diameters among brands. Precision CNC machined Delrin bearing insert arm adapter, providing a tight fit between the bearing and the control arm. Performance Instant, crisp steering and braking response. Easy to maintain, long-lasting performance. Improved road feel without undesirable NVH. Grease before installation and with each oil service with high-quality Moly grease for maximum service life.

Eventually the fluid filled rubber bushings fatigue and crack due to continual deflection and ozone degradation, and eventually the damping fluid leaks out resulting in complete failure. For the enthusiast looking for superior performance and longevity with a crisp, confidence-inspiring driving experience, our sealed ball joint monoballs are the best solution available! Our experience with spherical front control arm ball joints go back to those we designed and used in our IMSA E90 328i and E92 M3 racecars (GS class Champions in 2011). We wanted to offer F80, F82, F83, and F87 owners similar levels of handling precision and control for the track and street. The bearing housing is precision CNC machined from 6061-T6 anodized aluminum and features a knurled OD to ensure a perfect press fit, and utilize a sealed OEM BMW ball joint for exceptional quality and durability, making them completely at home on both the street and track with no compromise. We have done extensive street, autocross, and track testing to ensure the ball joint used in this bushing design excels in each setting. The advantage of a sealed ball joint is that it eliminates all unwanted deflection while still allowing complete bind-free movement throughout suspension travel, resulting in exceptional control of wheel alignment. What you get is superior steering precision, turn-in response, direct braking feedback, and better handling. In short, if you're seeking the ultimate in precise, predictable handling and control, with crisp braking response and a long service life that’s equally at home on the street or track - look no further. We have you covered. We offer these control arms with the monoball bushings pre-installed for your convenience. Since BMW recommends the control arms be replaced for every other bushing change, we prefer to sell these as a pre-assembled set. The bushings are also available separately if you wish to source your own control arms. Features: Bearing housing Precision CNC machined from 6061-T6 blue anodized aluminum Knurled OD to provide the perfect fit for the wide range of thrust arm bore diameters among brands. CNC machined 304ss ball joint sleeve inserts, providing a precision fit between the ball joint and the subframe. Bearing OEM BMW sealed and greased ball joint for exceptional durability and service life. Performance Nearly instantaneous, crisp steering and braking response. Maintenance free, long lasting performance. Improved road feel without undesirable NVH."

Tasked with keeping suspension geometry in check while absorbing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) factory rubber bushings were engineered to provide a balance of comfort and control. As a factory bushing ages, it becomes brittle and begins to harden. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow excess play in the suspension joint. This is typically felt by a sudden jerk forward after the car comes to a stop and is a leading cause of ""sloppy"" or ""loose"" suspension feel. By replacing the bushing with a full polyurethane unit or using a bushing insert, this play is eliminated since the suspension joint is being supported by a much stiffer material that will not harden or shrink over time. Additionally, the inherent stiffness of the urethane material translates body forces much more directly. This means steering inputs from the driver are effectively transferred to the wheels and vital road information is transmitted properly from the wheels to the driver."

Condor's conversion bushings are machined from UHMW due to its high rigidity and low coefficient of friction allowing for minimal suspension bushing deflection (geometry change). They've designed them offset to re-center the wheel and give your e30/e36 the correct caster. They will include a stainless-steel insert that tightly presses over the hex pattern on the E46 control arms. You do not need to grind down your control arms or make any other modifications to your chassis. Please note that you will need to use E36 outer tie rods and E90 inner tie rods when installing in an E30 or E36.

All of the rubber bushings move in all sorts of directions and that changes your alignment, especially when used with big brake kits or when driven hard. The condition worsens as the bushing wears out. The Dinan monoball sits in a CNC machined aluminum housing which has zero deflection. The monoball allows complete freedom of movement but only at the desired angles. What you get is superior steering precision, better handling from more consistent alignment, and almost infinite bushing life. And thanks to the inner liner and sealed rubber boots there's none of the extra noise or reduced service life of fully solid race bushings."

The original factory bushings are fluid filled and rely on the fluid to absorb vibration and resist deflection. When the fluid is gone the rubber left over cannot match the original bushing's strength. The left over rubber is not stiff enough to resist the movements from the suspension. The result is a lot of vibration and reduced feedback and response from the steering.Meyle has addressed this issue with bushings that are not fluid-filled. The bushing is made of solid rubber that will last longer than the original bushing and is a bit stiffer than new originals for better response and feel. The lack of play from the solid rubber design will mean sharper steering, restoring much of the car's precision and 'connected' feel.This is a package of Meyle HD control arms with the HD bushings already pressed in. This makes for an easy swap out-swap in install. These arms replace the existing stock upper control arms - otherwise known as a tension strut or strut support arm. It's the arm with the twist. The BMW part numbers for these arms are 31 12 1 141 717 and 31 12 1 141 718.Meyle is a German brand in business since 1958 and all of their products are TUV approved and meet or exceed ISO standards.

Symptoms of a worn suspension include a loose and imprecise feel to the steering, excessive shaking through the steering wheel, or sounds like squeaking, grinding or clunking. This kit will not only help address these issues but is designed to have superior performance compared to stock, and extend suspension life. The Turner engineering team set out to design a no-compromise solution that requires no modification and offers instantaneous cornering and braking response. Our control arm bearings utilize a unique grease-able spherical bearing that is both serviceable and replaceable, with integrated dust seals to help keep dirt and moisture out. This bearing offers considerable improvement in both precision and durability compared to other unsealed poly and delrin bushing inserts previously available, which can wear prematurely due to contamination. The bearing assembly utilizes the highest quality materials, precision machining quality, and components to ensure a perfect fit and longest lasting component life possible. These Turner rear trailing arm bushings (RTAB) now feature a much sought after sealed design. Turner recognized the popularity of their original RTAB design as well as the customer demand for this sealed upgrade, ultimately utilizing the same concept at the front control arm monoballs. A sealed design means not only that contaminants such as salt, grit, and road debris will not affect the bearing, but also means they require no lubrication or maintenance - ever! Adding strut reinforcement plates will help prevent the deformation of the strut tower and possible cracking. Upgrading the rear shock mounts and adding reinforcement plates is highly recommended because of the known failures with the mounts ripping apart. Replacing the lower trailing arm bushings with a ball joint will not only give a more solid feel in the suspension but last longer due to its rubber seal design.

These solid rubber bushings replace the inner bushing on the front upper control arm, also known as the thrust arm or tension stut (it's the arm with the outer ball joint pointing down). These are the OEM bushings with a metal sleeve insert for precise but comfortable steering feel and response. A direct replacement for the E90/E92/E93 M3 and E82 1M. Professional installation recommended since these bushings need to be 'compressed' while they are being pressed in.   This can also be used as an upgrade on non-M E82, E9X, and E89 Z4 models. The solid rubber of the M3 is a better and longer-lasting bushing than the fluid-filled stock E90 bushing. These M3 bushings are a bit stiffer than the original design so the steering and handling will be sharper while maintaining M3-levels of ride comfort.

The OEM bushings from Lemforder are filled with heavy fluid to help dampen vibrations and rough road surfaces that can make their way up through the chassis and into the steering. As the bushing wears, is compressed and expanded, and subjected to harsh environments the fluid can leak out or evaporate which will leave the bushing without much strength. This can lead to a shimmy in the steering wheel and vibrations in the braking and handling that are often mis-diagnosed as warped brake rotors on the E39 and E38. Replacing these bushings with new parts will restore the precision and tightness to your steering and suspension.The BMW part numbers for these arms are 31 12 1 092 609 and 31 12 1 092 610."

Tasked with keeping suspension geometry in check while absorbing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) factory rubber bushings were engineered to provide a balance of comfort and control. As a factory bushing ages, it becomes brittle and begins to harden. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow excess play in the suspension joint. This is typically felt by a sudden jerk forward after the car comes to a stop and is a leading cause of ""sloppy"" or ""loose"" suspension feel. By replacing the bushing with a full polyurethane unit or using a bushing insert, this play is eliminated since the suspension joint is being supported by a much stiffer material that will not harden or shrink over time. Additionally, the inherent stiffness of the urethane material translates body forces much more directly. This means steering inputs from the driver are effectively transferred to the wheels and vital road information is transmitted properly from the wheels to the driver."

These cars use a unique front suspension but the principle design and downside, is the same as almost all of the BMW 3-series since 1984. The inner and outer ball joints see a lot of wear as they are constantly in motion. With the heavy front end of the 4WD Xi, these components need frequent inspection and replacement. When the bushings and ball joints fail, the front end can shimmy and feel loose through the steering wheel. Excess play in the rubber bushings can cause alignment problems and sloppy steering. There is usually a knocking or clunking sound to further annoy you. We've assembled thispackage to replace everything on both front control arms and restore your BMW's exceptional driving dynamics.

Rubber suspension bushings are one of the first things to get swapped out for our race cars. The more solid the better when it comes to controlling the alignment and keeping your race setup consistent. We use as much solid material as the rules allow. With no deflection, solid bushings also give amazing feedback to the driver. For the M235iR, BMW had two specs for the rear control arms - stock stamped steel control arms with a rubber/neoprene bushing that is slightly stiffer than stock (2014-2015 spec) and these aluminum/stainless steel control arms with solid Heim-jointed ends (2016 spec). An additional benefit to the Heim joints is the arms are adjustable so the alignment can be perfectly dialed in. The front control arms use M3/M4 thrust arms and wishbones with sealed monoball joints. Full solid mounts and bushings will give you many setup options with razor sharp steering and chassis response. Note: 2016-spec rear control arms do not have a spring perch like the factory arms. These are for rear coil over shocks only."
