The JB Racing aluminum flywheels are a direct replacement for the stock flywheel and work with stock clutch components for an easy upgrade with very little downside.   Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street. The clutch behaves the same as it originally did - just with better throttle response and more power! The JB flywheel can also be rebuilt with a new clutch contact surface - you don't have to buy a new flywheel.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch).   This flywheel replaces the stock original single-mass flywheel and should only be used with the corresponding 'single-mass' clutch kit. According to BMW the single mass flywheel was installed in all 325i up to 12/86 production date but we have seen some later cars with a single-mass flywheel. The age of the car almost guarantees one or more clutch replacements and possibly a change to the original flywheel as well. You may not know which flywheel is currently installed until the flywheel cover or the transmission is removed.

The JB Racing aluminum flywheels are a direct replacement for the stock flywheel and work with stock clutch components for an easy upgrade with very little downside.   Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street. The clutch behaves the same as it originally did - just with better throttle response and more power! The JB flywheel can also be rebuilt with a new clutch contact surface - you don't have to buy a new flywheel.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch).

The original water pump uses a composite impeller, not plastic or metal, so the BMW pump will typically last 85,000+ miles before the bearings show signs of wear (the composite impeller is not the reason for preventative maintenance - it's the bearings). We prefer the OE BMW pump to the aftermarket brands because it uses the composite impeller, it has a proven reliability record, and the pricing represents a solid value upgrade. The pump is located on the front of the engine with the fan attached to it. The complexity of the S54 engine means the water pump has multiple gaskets and seals that should also be replaced. And if the thermostat has not been changed then this is the best time for a new one as well.     BMW designed this water pump to use a composite impeller. It is much stronger than the plastic pieces that were so problematic in the mid-90s. The aftermarket solution to the plastic issues was to use a metal impeller. This solved the impeller issues but created some others. The metal impeller is heavier than composite or plastic and that led to quicker bearing failure on the E36 pump (sometimes within a year). The possibility exists that the same premature bearing failure can happen on the E46 M3 metal impeller pumps as well. The heavier weight also has the drawback of using more horsepower since it requires more effort to move the heavier piece. The composite materials solve all of these issues - light weight, strong, long lasting, and relatively inexpensive. They also come with a two-year warranty (most aftermarket pumps are one year). Original BMW water pumps for the E36 (and most other modern BMWs) now use a composite impeller so any issues with factory pumps are long gone. Original BMW water pumps for the E46 M3 are known to last over 100,000 miles and the composite is still in excellent condition (failure is usually typical leaks from worn bearings). For preventative maintenance we recommend a replacement around 85,000 miles. Alternate part numbers: 11517838118, 11517838159.     2001-2006    M3"

Don't allow your clutch or flywheel let you down! The stock clutch is fine for a stock car or just a simple software upgrade. But anything more and it quickly becomes the weak link (especially with drag races or hard launches). The 135i/335i/535i/Z4 35i SPEC Stage 2+ clutch kit is perfect for owners who want a performance clutch that works great with simple bolt-on modifications and will have a minimum of downsides or trade-offs. SPEC has spent considerable time and effort on the 335i models to produce a performance clutch and flywheel package that holds up to track and drag strip demands but is also easy to live with for daily driving. This clutch kit is meant to be used only with a SPEC flywheel.   What was most important to them was offering a kit that has stock-like clutch pedal effort but will grab and hold when the car has been mildly tuned. Full bolt-on upgrades like software, intake, FMIC, E85 mix, or methanol demand a better clutch. The Stage 2+ with the flywheel has a peak torque rating of 545ft-lbs. With the SPEC single-mass flywheel the limitations of the stock flywheel are eliminated. The clutch in this Stage 2+ kit is self-adjusting, like the factory design, and the engagement point can be adjusted. The clutch disc has a sprung hub so it can be used with the single-mass flywheels with near-stock levels of noise, vibration, and refinement. See comments below for characteristics of each.   The Stage 2+ can be configured a few different ways depending on how you intend to use the car -       The Stage 2+ offers the best drivability for 90% of the tuned 335s out there but when going beyond bolt-on upgrades it would be best to go to a more advanced clutch stage.   SPEC Clutch is one of the premier clutch and flywheel suppliers to the tuner market. They are often found on the most highly tuned import and domestic vehicles. They are recent players in the German car community with a special focus on the newer turbo BMW models with high torque output.

Everyone knows that adding large amounts of boost and torque will expose weaknesses in other areas - the clutch being near the top of the list. The factory clutch works just fine on a stock 335 or with a mild upgrade like software and intake. But when you get into serious torque levels the stock clutch simply can't handle it. SPEC has focused heavily on the 335 market with 5 stages of upgraded 335 clutches. Stage 2+ is our favorite for mildly-tuned 335s, offering near stock levels of refinement and ample torque capacity (rated for 545ft-lbs). But when going beyond the usual bolt-on upgrades you need to look at your weakest links. The Stage 3+ clutch is rated for 671 ft-lbs. This clutch kit is meant to be used only with a SPEC flywheel (not the stock flywheel).   The Stage 3+ is for cars making serious levels of boost and torque. If you have upgraded turbos or a single-turbo conversion, or have checked off the list of full bolt-ons, this will be a very capable clutch for you. This clutch is designed to work only with a SPEC single-mass flywheel and avoid the pitfalls of the stock OEM flywheel. The stock dual mass flywheel uses springs and rubber to isolate vibrations from the engine and transmission. However, on high mileage or abused flywheels the rubber can break down and the springs will become weak. A worn dual mass flywheel limits the amount of torque you can put out. It will affect clutch engagement, shifts, and power delivery. In some cases a total flywheel failure can rip apart the flywheel, clutch, and even transmission housing. With the SPEC single-mass flywheel the limitations of the stock flywheel are eliminated. The SPEC flywheel is a single mass design (no internal springs or rubber to fail) and is offered in a steel or aluminum material. The steel will better dampen vibration than the aluminum so it's the better choice for street use. The aluminum will have greater vibration and noise (gearbox rattle) that may not be acceptable for everyone. The clutch in this Stage 3+ kit is a sprung hub design so SPEC has done all they can to minimize the noise and vibration. It's also self-adjusting, like the factory design, and the engagement point can be adjusted. See comments below for characteristics of each.

The JB Racing aluminum flywheels are a direct replacement for the stock flywheel and work with stock clutch components for an easy upgrade with very little downside.   Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street. The clutch behaves the same as it originally did - just with better throttle response and more power! The JB flywheel can also be rebuilt with a new clutch contact surface - you don't have to buy a new flywheel.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch).   This JB flywheel replaces the stock flywheel and can be used with either the stock 228mm or stock 240mm clutch discs. Depending on the model you may have either clutch size in your car but this flywheel is compatible with both. You can install a 240mm clutch as a mild upgrade.

The JB Racing aluminum flywheels are a direct replacement for the stock flywheel and work with stock clutch components for an easy upgrade with very little downside.   Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street. The clutch behaves the same as it originally did - just with better throttle response and more power! The JB flywheel can also be rebuilt with a new clutch contact surface - you don't have to buy a new flywheel.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable.

Lightweight flywheels have proven themselves to be a worthwhile performance enhancement. But with the quicker throttle response and horsepower improvement comes one serious drawback: flywheel chatter. Without the dual-mass flywheel's rubber isolators, a lightweight aluminum flywheel has more rattle than stock. We have designed our brand new flywheel using Chromoly steel, cutting weight by almost ten pounds vs the stock Dual-Mass Flywheel. The steel helps dampen vibration and noise so you get near-factory refinement and most of the benefits of a lightweight flywheel: quicker throttle response, better reliability, and more power to the wheels. Zero-balanced and SFI 1.1 certified (material and design has been independently burst tested to ensure quality and safety). Modern flywheels are built with additional components that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. Weight has increased and reliability has decreased. With additional weight, more energy is required for it to move. A lightweight flywheel does away with the dual mass design and its additional mass, so more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch are one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance. With a single-mass flywheel, the unreliable Dual-Mass Flywheel design is eliminated."

The Sachs HD clutch disc has a sprung hub to minimize noise and vibration and organic linings to give the feel and engagement of a stock M3. Mixing and matching of the incorrect clutch, pressure plate, and flywheel components can lead to inconsistent engagement and feel -- why make your clutch feel worse?   In addition, the Sachs HD pressure plate will clamp with greater force -- allowing approximately 350 ft-lbs of torque, which makes it an obvious upgrade from the stock clutch kit. And with the aluminum flywheel weight savings is substantial over the stock dual-mass flywheel - which allows your motor to spool up faster and transmit more HP to the ground.   Because Sachs is an OE supplier to most German cars, replacement parts are just a phone call away. This kit uses the stock throw-out bearing (included in the price).     2001-2006    (manual transmission only)"

This flywheel and clutch kit features twin carbon fiber/organic discs with a steel flywheel rated at over 900 ft-lbs of torque. Even with increased capability this clutch drives and functions almost the same as a stock clutch but with a more solid feel and better engagement. Where the stock clutch can feel weak and soft the SPEC clutch feels stronger and more capable. The SPEC flywheel included in this kit is also a superior alternative to the pricey factory dual-mass flywheel, which are known to wear out. If clutch or flywheel woes are keeping you from getting the most from your M3 V8 this is the clutch you should be using.   The SPEC clutch upgrade for the E9X M3 gives you a true twin disc clutch setup for the manual transmission models. Twin disc clutches have been common in racing events for years. Our World Challenge Touring Cars were among the first to use two or three disc racing clutches in BMW applications. We found many advantages to a multi-disc setup over a single disc - greater torque capacity, less heat build-up, and longer clutch life thanks to more surface area, and less weight in the clutch discs. One of the goals from SPEC was to keep clutch operation, noise, and stiffness as close to stock levels as possible. They use a special blend of organic, carbon, Kevlar, and metallic materials for a strong and durable clutch that is also user friendly on the street. It's a little stiffer than the stock clutch but after an adjustment period most drivers get used to it. This kit is supplied with a billet steel flywheel that better minimizes vibrations and clutch chatter than aluminum. The SPEC flywheel is also preferred over the factory dual-mass part which can wear out over time and need replacement anyway. Clutch rebuild parts are also available to minimize consumable costs and keep your car ready to use.   More aggressive clutch materials are available. The kit comes with a carbon fiber/Kevlar/organic material that is best-suited for street use and will offer the most user-friendly feel and engagement. For more performance capability you can opt for a carbon-graphite material but it will not be as user-friendly on the street. The carbon-graphite offers tremendous torque limits (1,125 ft-lbs) but the material will result in a more on/off clutch engagement with less usable slippage. It can be used on the street but will require more getting used to. Full metallic is also available but only for dedicated track or race cars.   SPEC Clutch is one of the premier clutch and flywheel suppliers to the tuner market. They are often found on the most highly tuned import and domestic vehicles. They are recent players in the German car community with a special focus on the E9X 335i twin turbo market. SPEC has been proven time after time to provide superior performance, drivability, and longevity to the most hardcore enthusiasts around the globe.   E9X M3 Flywheel Notes. BMW used a couple of different flywheel/clutch setups on the E90/E92 M3. In 2009 they switched to a new dual-mass flywheel design and all 2008 models must buy the new flywheel. The dual-mass flywheel remains a problem on all BMWs, especially for track-driven or supercharged cars where additonal torque and heat can weaken the rubber dampening material inside the flywheel. Often the flywheel requires replacement at the same time as the clutch. For the E9X M3 that can add another couple thousand to the cost. The SPEC flywheels remove the weak points in the clutch and flywheel assembly, and at a lower price point than the factory replacement parts!

The Stage 3 uses a semi-metallic and carbon clutch for strong engagement and high torque capacity (it's rated for 425 ft-lbs). Stage 3 is the same as Stage 4 but with double-sprung clutch for a smoother and quieter engagement. It's a more street-friendly version of the Stage 4 and popular among the turbo E30 crowd.   The stock clutch in the M20 E30 is not terrible but can become quickly overheated and lead to glazing on the flywheel surface and inconsistent engagement. A more robust material is needed to handle the extreme temperatures found at the track. The SPEC Stage 3 clutch consists of a carbon/semi-metallic friction material paired with a heavy-duty pressure plate. The clutch is stronger and grabs harder than the factory clutch. It has a much more robust feel and engagement. And with this specification the clutch will never be a weak point. The clutch is rebuildable to help minimize consumable costs.

The JB Racing aluminum flywheels are a direct replacement for the stock flywheel and work with stock clutch components for an easy upgrade with very little downside.   Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street. The clutch behaves the same as it originally did - just with better throttle response and more power! The JB flywheel can also be rebuilt with a new clutch contact surface - you don't have to buy a new flywheel.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch). In addition to the standard replacement clutches, we also sell Sachs Performance sprung hub clutches that also work with the JB flywheels.

The JB Racing aluminum flywheels are a direct replacement for the stock flywheel and work with stock clutch components for an easy upgrade with very little downside.   Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street. The clutch behaves the same as it originally did - just with better throttle response and more power! The JB flywheel can be rebuilt too with a new clutch contact surface.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch).

Where the stock clutch is well-known for premature wear when driven hard and the factory dual mass flywheel is a known failure point, the SPEC clutch delivers with an over-engineered, performance-oriented clutch solution. The single carbon-Kevlar clutch is rated at 430 ft-lbs, more than enough for a naturally-aspirated M54 engine. A heavy-duty pressure plate and throw-out bearing complete the package.   The stock 330 clutch was not designed for performance. It works fine for a daily driver street car with no mods but performance and longevity quickly drop off when adding more power or using the car for aggressive street, autocross, or track use. A lot of our customers also hate the self-adjusting clutch (SAC) mechanism and the clutch delay valve that makes clutch engagement inconsistent and unnatural feeling. It's no wonder that for the Grand-Am Cup touring car races the rules specified an E36 M3 clutch! If you're unhappy with the stock clutch feel or your future plans include additional upgrades that boost torque, then a heavy-duty clutch is what will be needed. The SPEC Stage 1 clutch consists of a hybrid carbon-Kevlar and organic friction material paired with a heavy-duty pressure plate. The clutch is stronger and grabs harder than the factory clutch. It has a much more robust feel and engagement. And with this specification the clutch will never be a weak point. The SPEC clutch is designed to work with the stock dual mass flywheel or with a lightweight aluminum single-mass flywheel.   The real weak point in the driveline is in the flywheel. The stock dual-mass flywheel has rubber damper discs inside that will wear out over time. Heat and aggressive driving will accelerate their wear. Even if the clutch contact surface is not showing wear the inner rubber linings most likely are. On most clutch replacements we strongly advise getting a new flywheel at the same time to avoid duplicating the work. You can use the SPEC clutch with the stock or an aluminum flywheel. A machined steel flywheel is also an option as a middle ground. Both the SPEC steel and aluminum flywheels are lighter than stock and will be single-mass. There will be a lot more noise and 'gearbox chatter' with the aluminum but the tradeoff is a much better acceleration and quicker revving. For daily driver commuting you will probably be happiest with the stock flywheel. For the ultimate in sports car feel use the aluminum.   SPEC Clutch is one of the premier clutch and flywheel suppliers to the tuner market. They are often found on the most highly tuned import and domestic vehicles. They are recent players in the German car community with a special focus on the newer turbo BMW models with high torque output.

As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street. The clutch behaves the same as it originally did - just with better throttle response and more power! The JB flywheel can also be rebuilt with a new clutch contact surface - you don't have to buy a new flywheel.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch).   The JB flywheel includes ignition trigger wheel.   This flywheel replaces the stock original single-mass flywheel and should only be used with the corresponding 'single-mass' clutch kit. According to BMW the single mass flywheel was installed in all 325e up to 5/86 production date but we have seen some later cars with a single-mass flywheel. The age of the car almost guarantees one or more clutch replacements and possibly a change to the original flywheel as well. You may not know which flywheel is currently installed until the flywheel cover or the transmission is removed.

Where the stock clutch is well-known for premature wear when driven hard and the factory dual mass flywheel is a known failure point, the SPEC clutch delivers with an over-engineered, performance-oriented clutch solution. The single carbon-Kevlar clutch is rated at 545 ft-lbs, more than enough for the naturally-aspirated S54 engines. A heavy-duty pressure plate and throw-out bearing complete the package.   The stock clutch in the S54 cars is not a terrible clutch and it is not under-rated (it's the same clutch disc used in the E39 M5). Our tuned M3 street and race cars have used the stock clutch with almost 400hp with only the occassional slip. But if the clutch is not grabbing like you want it to, or your tuning plans will include forced induction, a heavy-duty clutch is what will be needed. The SPEC Stage 2 clutch consists of a carbon-Kevlar friction material paired with a heavy-duty pressure plate. The clutch is stronger and grabs harder than the factory clutch. It has a much more robust feel and engagement. And with this specification the clutch will never be a weak point. The SPEC clutch is designed to work with the stock dual mass flywheel or the SPEC single-mass flywheel (steel or aluminum).   The real weak point in the driveline is in the flywheel. The stock dual-mass flywheel has rubber damper discs inside that will wear out over time. Heat and aggressive driving will accelerate their wear. Even if the clutch contact surface is not showing wear the inner rubber linings most likely are. On most clutch replacements we strongly advise getting a new flywheel at the same time to avoid duplicating the work. You can use the SPEC clutch with the stock or SPEC flywheel. Both the SPEC steel and aluminum flywheels are lighter than stock and will be single-mass. There will be a lot more noise and 'gearbox chatter' with the aluminum but the tradeoff is a much better acceleration and quicker revving. For daily driver commuting you will probably be happiest with the stock flywheel. For the ultimate in sports car feel use the aluminum. For the best of both worlds select the SPEC steel flywheel. It will not fail like the dual mass design but still has enough mass to dampen most engine vibrations.   SPEC Clutch is one of the premier clutch and flywheel suppliers to the tuner market. They are often found on the most highly tuned import and domestic vehicles. They are recent players in the German car community with a special focus on the newer turbo BMW models with high torque output.

The 135i/335i/535i/Z4 35i SPEC Stage 2+ clutch kit is perfect for owners who want a performance clutch that works great with simple bolt-on modifications and will have a minimum of downsides or trade-offs. SPEC has spent considerable time and effort on the 335i models to produce a performance clutch that holds up to track and drag strip demands but is also easy to live with for daily driving. This clutch kit is meant to be used only with the stock dual-mass flywheel and is the most user-friendly of the SPEC clutches we offer for the 135/335/535/Z4.   What was most important to them was offering a kit that has stock-like clutch pedal effort but will grab and hold when the car has been mildly tuned. Full bolt-on upgrades like software, intake, FMIC, E85 mix, or methanol demand a better clutch. The Stage 2+ has a peak torque rating of 545ft-lbs but note that the stock dual-mass flywheel will be a limiting factor to how much torque you can use. There have been cases of high mileage or abused flywheels coming apart with high torque tuned engines. We recommend using a new factory flywheel or jumping to the SPEC single-mass flywheel. The clutch in this Stage 2+ kit is self-adjusting, like the factory design, and the engagement point can be adjusted. The clutch disc is a rigid hub (not spring loaded) so it's best used with the stock dual mass flywheel.     The Stage 2+ offers the best drivability for 90% of the tuned 335s out there but when going beyond bolt-on upgrades it would be best to go to a more advanced clutch stage.

Stage 3+ differs from the Stage 3 by having a full face clutch surface instead of a 6-puck layout. It's smoother and easier to engage than the regular Stage 3 or Stage 4 and popular among the turbo E30 crowd.

Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission.

JB Racing has engineered this flywheel to accept the E36 M3's 240mm clutch. This opens up a lot of clutch and pressure plate options but we typically used this with a stock Sachs OEM clutch kit. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. The Sachs sprung hub clutch kit can also work for greater torque capacity and silent operation.   Lightweight flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable but since this flywheel is not as 'radical' as our other lightweight designs the gear rattle and other noises should be kept to a minimum. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch).

It goes beyond the standard Stage 1 upgrade with a higher-capacity clutch disc rated at 545ft-lbs! Where the stock clutch is well-known for premature wear when driven hard and the factory dual mass flywheel is a known failure point, the SPEC clutch delivers with an over-engineered, performance-oriented clutch solution.   The stock 330 clutch was not designed for performance. It works fine for a daily driver street car with no mods but performance and longevity quickly drop off when adding more power or using the car for aggressive street, autocross, or track use. A lot of our customers also hate the self-adjusting clutch (SAC) mechanism and the clutch delay valve that makes clutch engagement inconsistent and unnatural feeling. It's no wonder that for the Grand-Am Cup touring car races the rules specified an E36 M3 clutch! If you're unhappy with the stock clutch feel or your future plans include additional upgrades that boost torque, then a heavy-duty clutch is what will be needed. The SPEC Stage 2+ clutch consists of a carbon-Kevlar friction material paired with a heavy-duty pressure plate. The clutch is stronger and grabs harder than the factory clutch. It has a much more robust feel and engagement. And with this specification the clutch will never be a weak point. The SPEC clutch is designed to work with the stock dual mass flywheel or with a lightweight aluminum single-mass flywheel.   The real weak point in the driveline is in the flywheel. The stock dual-mass flywheel has rubber damper discs inside that will wear out over time. Heat and aggressive driving will accelerate their wear. Even if the clutch contact surface is not showing wear the inner rubber linings most likely are. On most clutch replacements we strongly advise getting a new flywheel at the same time to avoid duplicating the work. You can use the SPEC clutch with the stock or an aluminum flywheel. A machined steel flywheel is also an option as a middle ground. Both the SPEC steel and aluminum flywheels are lighter than stock and will be single-mass. There will be a lot more noise and 'gearbox chatter' with the aluminum but the tradeoff is a much better acceleration and quicker revving. For daily driver commuting you will probably be happiest with the stock flywheel. For the ultimate in sports car feel use the aluminum.   SPEC Clutch is one of the premier clutch and flywheel suppliers to the tuner market. They are often found on the most highly tuned import and domestic vehicles. They are recent players in the German car community with a special focus on the newer turbo BMW models with high torque output.

The JB flywheel can also be rebuilt with a new clutch contact surface - you don't have to buy a new flywheel.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch).   On the E30 325i, this flywheel replaces the stock original dual-mass flywheel and should only be used with the corresponding 'dual-mass' clutch kit. According to BMW the dual mass flywheel was installed in all 325i from 12/86 on but we have seen some later cars with a single-mass flywheel. The age of the car almost guarantees one or more clutch replacements and possibly a change to the original flywheel as well. You may not know which flywheel is currently installed until the flywheel cover or the transmission is removed.

The JB Racing aluminum flywheels are a direct replacement for the stock flywheel and work with stock clutch components for an easy upgrade with very little downside.   Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street.

The stock clutch in the S54 cars is not a terrible clutch and it is not under-rated (it's the same clutch disc used in the E39 M5). Our tuned M3 street and race cars have used the stock clutch with almost 400hp with only the occassional slip.

The SPEC clutch is designed to work with the stock dual mass flywheel or the SPEC single-mass flywheel (steel or aluminum).   The real weak point in the driveline is in the flywheel. The stock dual-mass flywheel has rubber damper discs inside that will wear out over time. Heat and aggressive driving will accelerate their wear. Even if the clutch contact surface is not showing wear the inner rubber linings most likely are. On most clutch replacements we strongly advise getting a new flywheel at the same time to avoid duplicating the work. You can use the SPEC clutch with the stock or SPEC flywheel. Both the SPEC steel and aluminum flywheels are lighter than stock and will be single-mass. There will be a lot more noise and 'gearbox chatter' with the aluminum but the tradeoff is a much better acceleration and quicker revving. For daily driver commuting you will probably be happiest with the stock flywheel. For the ultimate in sports car feel use the aluminum. For the best of both worlds select the SPEC steel flywheel. It will not fail like the dual mass design but still has enough mass to dampen most engine vibrations.   SPEC Clutch is one of the premier clutch and flywheel suppliers to the tuner market.

Through age, excessive heat, and aggressive use the rubber loses its resilience and the metal springs lose their strength and become brittle. If the clutch and flywheel have become overheated the internal grease may break down as well. A DMF failure can be massive and catastrophic, not to mention dangerous as bits of metal and rubber fling themselves through the transmission bellhousing. Heat and aggressive driving will accelerate the wear so race and track cars should have their stock flywheels replaced at regular intervals or with any new clutch.

Instead of picking a clutch from another car that may or may not work at all, the engineers at JB Racing have taken all of the guess work out of this upgrade and incorporated a Sachs HD sprung hub clutch with the correct pressure plate and combined it with our most-popular aluminum lightweight flywheel. The Sachs HD clutch disc has a sprung hub to minimize noise and vibration and organic linings to give the feel and engagement of a stock clutch. Mixing and matching of the incorrect clutch, pressure plate, and flywheel components can lead to inconsistent engagement and feel -- why make your clutch feel worse?   In addition, the Sachs HD pressure plate will clamp with greater force -- allowing approximately 350 ft-lbs of torque,which makes it an obvious upgrade from the stock clutch kit. And with the aluminum flywheel weight savings is substantial over the stock dual-mass flywheel - which allows your motor to spool up faster and transmit more HP to the ground.   Because Sachs is an OE supplier to most German cars, replacement parts are just a phone call away. This kit uses the stock throw-out bearing (included in the price!).

The JB Racing aluminum flywheels are a direct replacement for the stock flywheel and work with stock clutch components for an easy upgrade with very little downside.   Modern flywheels are built with additional components and features that are designed to dampen and minimize vibrations from the engine and transmission. As a result they have become bloated in weight and that means more energy is used up just making the flywheel spin. The weight difference between an aluminum and steel flywheel is huge - sometimes more than 50% less. Without the additional mass, more energy can be diverted to where it counts most - moving the car. The flywheel and clutch is one of the first areas that engine builders address when making the rotating assembly lighter for race engines. The dampening effect is just not needed on cars that are focused on performance.   In addition to releasing more power to the wheels, the lighter flywheel allows the engine to spin more freely, which improves throttle response. Again, the difference is huge as you watch the revs build faster than before. With the engine spinning easier the power band comes up much sooner. The stock steel flywheel feels lazy in comparison. There is a driving adjustment required to get used to how much faster the engine revs but that's not really a downside.   The JB lightweight flywheel is designed to be used with a factory organic clutch - the same clutch kit that you would get from any BMW dealer. This makes replacement clutch components easy to source and inexpensive when compared to specialized racing clutches. By using the factory BMW clutch, JB has also made the whole assembly easy to live with when used on the street. The clutch behaves the same as it originally did - just with better throttle response and more power! The JB flywheel can also be rebuilt with a new clutch contact surface - you don't have to buy a new flywheel.   Aluminum flywheels are considered 'single-mass' flywheels because they do not have the same dampening designs as an original 'dual-mass' flywheel. With a single-mass design more noise and vibration may be noticeable. There are steps you can take to minimize the noise - heavier weight transmission oil and clutch discs with anti-rattle springs (sprung-hub clutch).

The UUC Twin Disk kit for the 540 borrows the technology from their renowned M5 kit and is spec'd to handle up to 600 or 800 ft-lbs of torque depending on the clutch material. The UUC clutch kit uses two clutch discs to smoothly handle the torque and horsepower from normally-aspirated or supercharged M62 or M62TU engines. They offer a stage 1 with an organic material similar to the stock clutch. But with double the clutch surface (with a second disc) this clutch will not suffer the same ills as any other stock, oem, or performance clutch offered for this car. UUC also offers this as a stage 2 with a metallic Feramic material for greater resistance to heat (recommended only for the highest tuned cars). This kit works with the stock hydraulics and the pressure plate has been engineered to give near stock types of engagement and feel. This makes this kit a great option for every day use.   For higher-tuned M5s with forced induction, upgrading the clutch meant living with the stereotype ""on/off switch"" with rough engagement characteristics that made daily-driving a compromise. By incorporating multi-disks, the UUC design maintains near-original smooth operation yet easily handles power levels approaching 1,000hp.    Developing class-leading flywheel and clutch technology to even greater heights, UUC has developed a significantly new Twin Disk flywheel/clutch package designed for BMWs developing the highest levels of power from a turbo boost or supercharging. Two disks is that much more torque capacity and that much more tolerance of hardcore flogging.    Total rotating mass of the complete flywheel and twin clutch package is 25.5lbs.

Using this tool results in significant time savings and repeatable alignment settings when doing street or track suspension setups.   During typical alignment work the adjustments are made from the tie rods without first centering the rack (having even lengths of the rack exposed). If the rack is off-center when the tie rods are adjusted your steering will not have the correct number of turns and unequal turning radius left to right. A centered steering rack also prevents handling issues such as uneven bump steer and inconsistent steering resistance. This makes for more work for the technician but ensures your steering is consistent.   With this tool, every alignment will have the rack in the same place every time, which can save time when doing a quick check of toe after a hard day at the track or on the street. If your steering rack is in the same place for every alignment then the steering wheel will also be in the same place, hence eliminating the need to reset the steering wheel. Every time a toe adjustment is done and the tie rod is moved without the alignment tool, it moves the steering rack, resulting in having to recheck all alignment numbers after each adjustment, resulting in having to set up the alignment equipment after every adjustment. If you have ever used strings to set up your car you know how much having to restring the car can slow you down.
