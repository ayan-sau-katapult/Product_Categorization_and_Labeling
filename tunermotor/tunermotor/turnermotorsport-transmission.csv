It's no wonder that these mounts have found their way into the top BMW racers in the country. These are machined from solid aluminum and have zero deflection, engine torque will cause a rubber or urethane mount to flex or deflect allowing more torque to passed through the drive line (instead of being wasted winding up the mount). This puts the shift linkages in better consistent alignment. And unlike rubber or urethane the aluminum has zero wear and is not affected by leaking oil or other fluids so this is likely the last set of transmission mounts you will ever need. We very strongly recommend using the solid transmission and engine mounts together as a complete kit, mixing a rubber mount with a metal mount will cause undue stress on the mounting points and will lead to a failure. We never advise using a solid mount unless a corresponding solid mount is also used.These are a no-compromise design for all-out racing use, full solid aluminum mounts should not be used on street-driven cars since there is no material to absorb vibration making these quite harsh for regular street use (track cars don't care about noise)."

Red Line thoroughly evaluates the manufacturer's recommendations and only makes a fluid recommendation if their own product meets or exceeds the original specification. In many cases the Red Line synthetic will outperform the factory supplied fluids. We've been using Red Line Oil in our BMWs since we opened in 1994 and it remains our best selling BMW differential fluid. 75/90 is the weight most commonly used in BMW differentials since the 1960s, including the factory clutch-type limited-slip diffs (exceptions being M3/M5/M6 cars since 2001). We use 75W90 in nearly all BMW chassis and the custom differentials that we sell.

We also use it in some track cars that don't already use the more aggressive 75/90NS fluid (without friction modifiers).

In addition to the shifter linkage the transmission mounts contribute to rough and clunky shifting. BMW transmission mounts are rubber and get softer over time. This allows the transmission to dance around which changes the geometry of the shift linkage and could make it harder to shift. These urethane transmission bushings are stiffer than the stock rubber mounts and won't let the transmission shift around as much. The round design also has more surface area than the stock mounts which helps spread the load. Because the urethane is stiffer, expect more vibration to make its way into the shift lever area. Engine motor mounts should also be considered as a cause for driveline vibration, transmission movement, and poor shifting. Consider replacing your motor mounts at the same time as your tranny mounts."

This plastic pan will experience numerous drastic heat cycles over its lifetime, causing it to become weak and brittle, leading to potential catastrophic failure. Not only is this dangerous, but this is also very expensive when factoring in regular services. Upgrade your BMW's ZF transmission pan to PPE's Heavy-Duty Aluminum Transmission Pan and be done with pan replacements! PPE's one-of-a-kind transmission oil pan is cast from high-strength aluminum, allowing this pan to be used for the life of your transmission while also providing multiple benefits over your stock pan. Thanks to the thicker aluminum construction, internal heat fins, and integrated external cool fins, this pan helps promote reduced transmission fluid temperatures. PPE's trans pan has also been designed to allow for an additional quart of transmission fluid. The combined benefits of both cooler trans fluid and greater fluid capacity results in better lubrication, increased service life, and longer track sessions! That's not all! To top it all off, this pan also includes a high-powered Neodymium magnet built into the drain plug, preventing metal contaminants from being cycled through your transmission and causing damage. Replaces Genuine BMW part number: 24118612901 Need a replacement filter?

These 4 quarts cover the manual transmission, transfer case, and the front and rear differentials.    We don't believe in ""lifetime fluids"". With BMW transmission life seemingly becoming shorter with each generation, we think it's just good-ole' common sense to replace the fluid at regular intervals (35-50,000 miles). Let's face it: transmission fluid at 50, 70, or 100,000 miles is not going to be as effective as when it left the factory. And if you drive your BMW like a driving machine and not like hearse, you'll want the extra protection that regular fluid changes offer.   In our TMS Service bays we use Red Line Synthetic Oils. Theyhave been enormously effective on the racetrack - helping us to win dozens of races and championships. And their track-record on the street is second-to-none. Red Line Oil is designed not to be a 'lifetime' fluid with compromises inperformance made for longevity. Red Line is simply designed to be the best lubricant you can use in any application. Red Line D4 ATF oil meets the requirements where Dexron III and Mercon fluids are specified. The 75/90 gear lube exceeds API GL5 standards."

Continuous friction in your engine creates tiny metal particles that contaminate the oil. These particles are measured in microns (one millionth of a meter: 25 microns = .001""). Oil filters catch the particles larger than about 35 microns, but they do not remove the smaller particles. Even after an oil change, there are still contaminants left in the engine. Over time, these metal particles are circulated millions of times, polishing (wearing) down the metal components inside your engine, degrading the engine's performance and shortening its life until it wears out. Magnetic drain plugs remove the smaller metal particles the oil filter can't, extending the useful life of your engine. It is also less likely that you will experience oil oxidation, as the metal particles that contribute to the process of oxidation adhere to the magnet. We think Dimple™ makes the finest magnetic drain plugs we've ever used. What makes Dimple™ plugs different from other magnetic drain plugs? The magnets. All magnets are not created equal -- Dimple's ""Black Hole™"" high-temperature magnets are the strongest, high-temperature, neodymium magnets in the world. Regular magnets lose magnetism at 175° F; Dimple's neodymium magnets are rated at over 300° F, so they continue to grab those destructive metal particles even when things get hot. In addition, Dimple's magnets degrade at the incredibly slow rate of ½ of 1% every 100 years, so they are guaranteed to work throughout your lifetime. Plus: Custom made for BMW vehicles, featuring a large 8 mm neodymium magnet rated at 300° F. M24 x 1.5 x 14"

This flywheel and clutch kit features twin carbon fiber/organic discs with a steel flywheel rated at over 900 ft-lbs of torque. Even with increased capability this clutch drives and functions almost the same as a stock clutch but with a more solid feel and better engagement. Where the stock clutch can feel weak and soft the SPEC clutch feels stronger and more capable. The SPEC flywheel included in this kit is also a superior alternative to the pricey factory dual-mass flywheel, which are known to wear out. If clutch or flywheel woes are keeping you from getting the most from your V10 this is the clutch you should be using.   The SPEC clutch upgrade for the M5/M6 gives you a true twin disc clutch setup in the SMG models. Twin disc clutches have been common in racing events for years. Our World Challenge Touring Cars were among the first to use two or three disc racing clutches in BMW applications. We found many advantages to a multi-disc setup over a single disc - greater torque capacity, less heat build-up, and longer clutch life thanks to more surface area, and less weight in the clutch discs. One of the goals from SPEC was to keep clutch operation and noise as close to stock levels as possible. They use a special blend of organic, carbon, Kevlar, and metallic materials for a strong and durable clutch that is also user friendly on the street. This kit is supplied with a billet steel flywheel that better minimizes vibrations and clutch chatter than aluminum. The SPEC flywheel is also preferred over the factory dual-mass part which can wear out over time and need replacement anyway. Clutch rebuild parts are also available to minimize consumable costs and keep your car ready to use.   More aggressive clutch materials are available. The kit comes with a carbon fiber/Kevlar/organic material that is best-suited for street use and will offer the most user-friendly feel and engagement. For more performance capability you can opt for a carbon-graphite material but it will not be as user-friendly on the street. The carbon-graphite offers tremendous torque limits (1,125 ft-lbs) but the material will result in a more abrupt clutch engagement with less usable slippage.   SPEC Clutch is one of the premier clutch and flywheel suppliers to the tuner market. They are often found on the most highly tuned import and domestic vehicles. They are recent players in the German car community with a special focus on the newer turbo BMW models with high torque output. SPEC has been proven time after time to provide superior performance, drivability, and longevity to the most hardcore enthusiasts around the globe.   E60 M5 E63 M6 SPEC Clutch Kit contents:  + billet steel flywheel  + twin-disc clutch plates with friction surface  + heavy-duty pressure plate  + heavy duty throw-out bearing     2006-2010    M5  2006-2010    M6"

Continuous friction in your differential creates tiny metal particles that contaminate the oil. These particles are measured in microns (one-millionth of a meter: 25 microns = .001""). Even after a fluid change, there are still contaminants left in the transmission. Over time, these metal particles are circulated millions of times, polishing (wearing) down the metal components inside your transmission, shortening the transmission's life until it wears out. Magnetic drain plugs remove the metal particles, extending your transmission's useful life. It is also less likely that you will experience oil oxidation, as the metal particles that contribute to the process of oxidation adhere to the magnet. We think Dimple™ makes the finest magnetic drain plugs we've ever used. What makes Dimple™ plugs different from other magnetic drain plugs? The magnets. All magnets are not created equal -- Dimple's ""Black Hole™"" high-temperature magnets are the strongest, high-temperature, neodymium magnets in the world. Regular magnets lose magnetism at 175° F; Dimple's neodymium magnets are rated at over 300° F, so they continue to grab those destructive metal particles even when things get hot. In addition, Dimple's magnets degrade at the incredibly slow rate of ½ of 1% every 100 years, so they are guaranteed to work throughout your lifetime. Plus: Custom made for BMW vehicles, featuring a large 8 mm neodymium magnet rated at 300° F. M10 x 1.0"

Continuous friction in your transmission creates tiny metal particles that contaminate the oil. These particles are measured in microns (one millionth of a meter: 25 microns = .001""). Oil filters catch the particles larger than about 35 microns, but they do not remove the smaller particles. Over time, these metal particles are circulated millions of times, polishing (wearing) down the metal components inside your transmission, shortening it's life. Magnetic drain plugs remove these smaller metal particles. We think Dimple™ makes the finest magnetic drain plugs we've ever used. What makes Dimple™ plugs different from other magnetic drain plugs? The magnets. All magnets are not created equal -- Dimple's ""Black Hole™"" high-temperature magnets are the strongest, high-temperature, neodymium magnets in the world. Regular magnets lose magnetism at 175° F; Dimple's neodymium magnets are rated at over 300° F, so they continue to grab those destructive metal particles even when things get hot. In addition, Dimple's magnets degrade at the incredibly slow rate of ½ of 1% every 100 years, so they are guaranteed to work throughout your lifetime. Custom made for BMW vehicles, featuring a large 8 mm neodymium magnet rated at 300° F. M24 x 1.5 measurement"
