Developed by BMW tuning expert Jim Conforti, this device plugs into the car's diagnostic port and flashes new performance files into your car's engine computer (ECU). There's no removal of the ECU and shipping, no cables, no laptop required - only a battery charger! Installation takes just a few minutes and your engine will perform like never before!     The M54 performance software was developed on the dyno to create maximum power and torque using premium 91+ octane fuel while maintaining BMW reliability and smoothness. The software makes changes to the ECU's maps and algorithms for fuel injection, ignition timing, VANOS and camshaft movement, and transitional fueling. A lot of tuning has been done at the low RPM ranges to improve response. We modify the maps for part throttle and full throttle so you get better response and more torque at all RPM. We also raise the rev limit to 7,000 and remove the top speed limiter. By fine tuning these maps we've been able to improve the M54/M56 engine beyond what BMW did by making more power and torque and a smoother-running engine.     The Shark Injector plugs into the diagnostic port inside the E46 cabin. With the battery charger supplying power, press the Upgrade button and within minutes the ECU is reflashed with the new performance tune. No other software product on the market comes close to how easy it is to install. You can use the Restore button to re-install the stock BMW software at any time. Detailed instructions are included. Other tuners require you to remove the ECU and ship it to them or use a laptop to read and write a new file. The Shark Injector is ready to install right out of the box! A planned future upgrade will allow you to use the USB port to load different performance files.                     2001-2006      330i 330ci 330xi",New Rev Limit,7000 RPM,2004-2006 E46 330i ZHP (M54 engine) Performance Software Peak Gains,https://1c2a8a2161d644d95009-22d26b38e78c173d82b3a9a01c774ffa.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/image/dyno/ZHP.pdf,330i ZHP dyno chart,HP Gain,+ 14 @ 6400 RPM,Torque Gain,+ 11 @ 4100 RPM,New Rev Limit,7000* RPM,E46 330i ZHP Rev Limits,(click to expand),There are multiple versions of stock ZHP software and BMW used different rev limits in some of them. A ZHP automatic will always have a lower rev limit than a manual in the interest of preserving the automatic transmission. Our engine software will alter the rev limit set in the ECU but other limits in the auto transmission programming will maintain the factory rev limit. Manual ZHPs have stock rev limits that vary - some are set as high as 6920 by the factory software.

Developed by BMW tuning expert Jim Conforti, this device plugs into the car's diagnostic port and flashes new performance files into your car's engine computer (ECU). There's no removal of the ECU and shipping, no cables, no laptop required - only a battery charger! Installation takes just a few minutes and your engine will perform like never before! The M5 performance software was developed on the dyno to create maximum power and torque using premium 91+ octane fuel and revising the torque limiters in the ECU. The software makes changes to the ECU's maps and algorithms for fuel injection, ignition timing, VANOS and camshaft movement, and transitional fueling. We modify the maps for part throttle and full throttle so you get better response and more torque at all RPM. The stock software artificially limits torque output, especially in the first three gears. We raised the torque limiters in all gears so there is more torque available. You will see an immediate difference as soon as you leave your driveway! Choose between a stock 7,000 or raised 7,400 RPM rev limit. The top speed limiter is removed. By fine tuning these maps we've been able to improve the S62 engine beyond what BMW did by making more power and torque and a smoother-running engine. Gains of 23 hp @ 6100 rpm and 19 lb/ft torque @ 5000 rpm!!! We used several E39 M5s on our dyno to establish what the average/typical power numbers are. The dyno charts on the right are from the same car - a 2003 E39 M5 that was already equipped with intakes, mufflers, and running 93 octane. For our Shark Injector dynos we made baseline runs with the stock software and then runs in 3rd gear and 4th gear. The only changes to the car was the Shark Injector software. Why did we post dyno runs in different gears? The 3rd gear run shows the torque gain with the new torque limiters in the software. The 4th gear run is posted to be consistent with the industry-standard of dyno-ing cars in 4th gear. Note: comparing dyno results and wheel horsepower numbers from one shop to another is not advised. What really matters is the gain from stock to modified from the same car on the same dyno. The Shark Injector plugs into the diagnostic port inside the E39 cabin. With the battery charger supplying power, press the Upgrade button and within minutes the ECU is reflashed with the new performance tune. No other software product on the market comes close to how easy it is to install. You can use the Restore button to re-install the stock BMW software at any time. Detailed instructions are included.

A planned future upgrade will allow you to use the USB port to load different performance files. * This Shark Injector will disable the flow output of the Secondary Air Injection system (SAI), an infamous flaw that affects all M5s. This software will prevent fault codes and check engine lights due to blockages of the SAI system due to carbon build-up. One of the causes of SAI faults is when the ECU detects low output from the air pump. The Shark software will no longer monitor the output of the pump, therefore the fault will never occur. This software does not disable the air pump altogether (necessary to preserve your catalytic converters) and does not ""fix"" exisiting SAI performance (you may still need a new air pump). For more information on the M5 SAI system, read our E39 M5 SAI carbon build-up page by clicking here. Read what others are saying!

For 93 we can be more aggressive with the timing and get more power. But you must have 93+ octane available, using the 93 version with anything less is not recommended.  Choose an aggressive throttle response or a smoother, linear setting. The Shark enhanced throttle will be much quicker and more in line with the Motorsport inspiration of the M5. The Euro throttle is more linear in response and smoother than the stock US or Shark throttle. The Euro throttle is also known as the 'M5Board tune'. Our customers are split 50/50 so there is no ""best throttle"" mapping - it's personal preference.  Choose a stock 7,000 RPM or raised 7,400 RPM rev limit. The raised rev limit is great for track or autocross where you can stay in gear longer and avoid untimely upshifts. The stock rev limit is for the non-track customer who wants all of the other benefits without the need to rev beyond the stock setting.  This option will make Sport Mode active only when DSC is turned off. The Sport Mode button is disabled altogether so the only way to get Sport is to disable DSC. The Shark Injector plugs into the diagnostic port inside the E39 cabin. With the battery charger supplying power, press the Upgrade button and within minutes the ECU is reflashed with the new performance tune. No other software product on the market comes close to how easy it is to install. You can use the Restore button to re-install the stock BMW software at any time. Detailed instructions are included. Other tuners require you to remove the ECU and ship it to them or use a laptop to read and write a new file. The Shark Injector is ready to install right out of the box! A planned future upgrade will allow you to use the USB port to load different performance files.",Looking to maximize your power gains?

Developed by BMW tuning expert Jim Conforti, this device plugs into the car's diagnostic port and flashes new performance files into your car's engine computer (ECU). There's no removal of the ECU and shipping, no cables, no laptop required - only a battery charger! Installation takes just a few minutes and your engine will perform like never before!   The M54 performance software was developed on the dyno to create maximum power and torque using premium 91+ octane fuel while maintaining BMW reliability and smoothness. The software makes changes to the ECU's maps and algorithms for fuel injection, ignition timing, VANOS and camshaft movement, and transitional fueling. We modify the maps for part throttle and full throttle so you get better response and more torque at all RPM. We also raise the rev limit to 7,000 and remove the top speed limiter. By fine tuning these maps we've been able to improve the M54 engine beyond what BMW did by making more power and torque and a smoother-running engine.
