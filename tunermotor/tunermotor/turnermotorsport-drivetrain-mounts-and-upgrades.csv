The advantages of a fully-solid aluminum set is that they last forever, quickens response in the suspension, and frees up horsepower to the wheels. These fully solid aluminum diff mounts are CNC machined and lightened for a direct replacement of the original rubber pieces.   By substituting aluminum for rubber we can take out all of the deflection and 'wind up' inherent to the original rubber pieces. The high deflection rate of the stock rubber means the suspension reacts slower as the bushing is compressed. The power used to compress that bushing is instead passed straight to the axles and wheels. And since there is no time lost to deflection, response is greatly improved. These diff mounts are only recommended for racecars since the aluminum transfers more noise and vibration.   This is a 3-piece set with a single front bushing and two rear bushings to press into the cover. They mount with the stock BMW hardware.     2001-2006    M3"

It's no wonder that these mounts have found their way into the top BMW racers in the country. We originally developed these mounts for E36 and E46 World Challenge racing but they also work perfect in BMW Modified and SCCA club racing and SpecE46 (SE46). These are machined from solid aluminum and have zero deflection. The engine torque will cause a rubber or urethane mount to flex or deflect. The stiffer the material the less movement there is and the more torque is passed through the driveline (instead of being wasted winding up the mount). At the transmission end the flex-free solid mounts will give smoother, crisper shifts since the transmission is no longer dancing on the pliable mount. This puts the shift linkages in better consistent alignment. And unlike rubber or urethane the aluminum has zero wear and is not affected by leaking oil or other fluids so this is likely the last set of motor and transmission mounts you will ever need. We have designed these mounts so the engine is 5mm lower and the transmission is 1mm lower than the factory mounts. This helps lower the center of gravity for better balance and handling. We very strongly recommend using the transmission and engine mounts together as a complete kit. Mixing a rubber mount with a metal mount will cause undue stress on the mouting points and will lead to a failure. We never advise using a solid mount unless a corresponding solid mount is also used. This kit fits the E36, E46, Z3, and Z4 6 cylinder models listed below, including M3 models.   These are a no-compromise design for all-out racing use. Full solid aluminum mounts should not be used on street-driven cars. Because there is no material to absorb vibration these will be quite harsh for regular street use (track cars don't care about noise).     are very strongly recommended to go along with these solid motor mounts to reduce the risk of damage to the subframe. The motor mount section of the subframe should be reinforced to prevent stress and failure of the subframe.     1992-1999    323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3  1999-2006    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 328i 328ci 330i 330ci M3  2001-2006    330i 330ci  1997-2002    Z3 2.3 Z3 2.5i Z3 2.8 Z3 3.0i M Roadster M Coupe  2003-2005    Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i  2006-2008    Z4 M Roadster M Coupe"

They are a soft rubber, mainly designed to absorb vibration. But over time the rubber becomes more and more pliable and that causes the transmission to move excessively and the shifter linkage to bind, leading to tougher and inconsistent shifting. A mis-shift can lead to a very expensive engine rebuild.   The UUC tranny mounts are much stiffer than the originals and can be used with an aluminum cup to deflect load over a greater area. This will keep the transmission and shift linkage where they're supposed to be and virtually eliminate a mis-shift caused by the linkage binding. UUC's mounts are a heavy-duty rubber or urethane. Black rubber mounts are for street applications; Red/blue urethane is for track/light street use. Since both styles are a stiffer durometer than the stock rubber, some additional vibration and noise will make it into the cabin. With the Black mounts, the vibration is really not much more than stock. There will be a noticeable amount more with the Red/blue mounts. The Enforcer cups are ideal for track driven cars as they contribute to additional noise & vibration. Note that worn transmission mounts may also be masking vibrations from worn engine mounts too, and it's a good idea to replace your motor mounts at regular intervals or the same time as installing new transmission mounts. The optional aluminum Trans Mount Enforcers fit over the top of the mounts and give additional strength to the whole design (recommended for track cars, not generally needed or recommended on street cars.)

The stock mounts are filled with fluid that can leak or evaporate over time. That leaves the mount unstable and too flexible to properly support the engine. The side effects of a worn engine mount are: shaking and vibrating engine, driveline twist from engine torque that can break or snap bushings, and broken motor mount arms and bolts. If you're tired of replacing engine mounts you'll be very pleased with these solid rubber versions. Not only are these more reliable than stock fluid-filled mounts, they are slightly stiffer than new stock mounts thanks to a solid rubber construction (no voids in the rubber) but designed for street use so they remain quiet and comfortable. The solid rubber has less deflection than a stock mount, so no wasted engine motion. Less wasted motion gives you more torque to the wheels (it's not spent twisting the engine) and better engine response."

In addition to the shifter linkage the transmission mounts contribute to rough and clunky shifting. BMW transmission mounts are rubber and get softer over time. This allows the transmission to dance around which changes the geometry of the shift linkage and could make it harder to shift. These urethane transmission bushings are stiffer than the stock rubber mounts and won't let the transmission shift around as much. The round design also has more surface area than the stock mounts which helps spread the load. Because the urethane is stiffer, expect more vibration to make its way into the shift lever area. Engine motor mounts should also be considered as a cause for driveline vibration, transmission movement, and poor shifting. Consider replacing your motor mounts at the same time as your tranny mounts."

While OE rubber bushings are fine when they are new from the factory, aged and worn out rubber bushings create a multitude of issues that can range from annoying to dangerous. As a factory bushing ages, it begins to harden and become brittle. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point.

The engine can shift and contact other things in the engine compartment, mostly cooling-related parts. This is especially troublesome on the 1984-1987 models as the alternator belt and blades can cut into the lower radiator hose. Don't neglect your motor mounts! A worn motor mount allows the engine to twist and shift around. The harder you're driving the more shift will occur. Twisting of the engine can also lead to shifting problems as the transmission twists with it. There are countless issues related to worn or compressed motor mounts so don't overlook these as a regular replacement item (every 50,000 miles).    For more serious track or street cars we recommend    These are a stiffer mount to begin with (coming from the Euro 635CSi) and the aluminum cups give additional strength especially for the side-side shearing loads that you get from cornering.

With a stiffer mount the differential will not deflect as much. This improves seat-of-the-pants feeling to the driver, giving more feedback for smoother power delivery. In theory, there's also more torque being sent to the drive wheels since it's not being used up shifting the diff weight around."

It's no wonder that these mounts have found their way into the top BMW racers in the country. These are machined from solid aluminum and have zero deflection, engine torque will cause a rubber or urethane mount to flex or deflect allowing more torque to passed through the drive line (instead of being wasted winding up the mount). When paired with our flex-free solid transmission mounts you'll get smoother, crisper shifts since the transmission is no longer dancing on the pliable mount. This puts the shift linkages in better consistent alignment. And unlike rubber or urethane the aluminum has zero wear and is not affected by leaking oil or other fluids so this is likely the last set of motor and transmission mounts you will ever need. We very strongly recommend using the solid transmission and engine mounts together as a complete kit, mixing a rubber mount with a metal mount will cause undue stress on the mounting points and will lead to a failure. We never advise using a solid engine mount unless a corresponding solid transmission mount is also used.These are a no-compromise design for all-out racing use, full solid aluminum mounts should not be used on street-driven cars since there is no material to absorb vibration making these quite harsh for regular street use (track cars don't care about noise)."

The differential is part of the subframe, as it is a stress member system. When the subframe moves, so do all of the rear suspension mounting points. Replacing the stock rubber subframe bushings with solid aluminum will limit drivetrain and suspension movement and keep your car’s suspension geometry the way it’s supposed to be. The Delrin diff mount bushing is a near-solid mount that will last longer than the original rubber and does not 'wind up' under load/unload. This transfers more power through the axles to the wheels. The Turner Motorsport E36 318ti and Z3 solid subframe and differential mount bushing kit is a direct replacement for the stock BMW subframe mounts and differential bushing. We have incorporated ideas from our other race style solid bushings not only make these very light weight but also to be fully serviceable and removable in the case of subframe or diff cover replacement. This kit is a legal upgrade in many racing classes.   Note: solid subframe mounts are only sold with the solid diff mount. Using a rubber diff mount with the solid subframe mount will result in excessive deflection and twist in the diff mount.

If your original bushings are worn (likely around 100,000 miles) these are a great replacement upgrade. The front bushings are the stock OEM type rubber bushings. The rear bushing is a Meyle HD upgrade over stock - about 15% stiffer than the originals. This means the bushing will not flex and twist as much. This puts more power to the wheels since power is no longer used up for 'torquing' the bushing. These are not race bushings; the rubber material is perfectly suitable for street use.   The non-M E46/E83/Z4 models use three differential mounts - two front bushings in the subframe and one rear mount in the diff cover. This set of bushings covers all three.

While OE rubber bushings are fine when they are new from the factory, aged and worn out rubber bushings create a multitude of issues that can range from annoying to dangerous. As a factory bushing ages, it begins to harden and become brittle. When this happens the bushing will actually shrink and allow for movement at the differential mounting point. At this point, the differential is free to shift under load causing a noticeable clunking noise under acceleration and deceleration and massively increasing the stress on the driveshaft and axles. Manual transmissions suffer the worst from this as it can make shifting difficult since the differential will shift when the clutch is engaged and disengaged."

Continuous friction in your engine creates tiny metal particles that contaminate the oil. These particles are measured in microns (one millionth of a meter: 25 microns = .001""). Oil filters catch the particles larger than about 35 microns, but they do not remove the smaller particles. Even after an oil change, there are still contaminants left in the engine. Over time, these metal particles are circulated millions of times, polishing (wearing) down the metal components inside your engine, degrading its performance and shortening the engine's life until it wears out. Magnetic drain plugs remove the smaller metal particles the oil filter can't, extending the useful life of your engine. It is also less likely that you will experience oil oxidation, as the metal particles that contribute to the process of oxidation adhere to the magnet. We think Dimple™ makes the finest magnetic drain plugs we've ever used. What makes Dimple™ plugs different from other magnetic drain plugs? The magnets. All magnets are not created equal -- Dimple's ""Black Hole™"" high-temperature magnets are the strongest, high-temperature, neodymium magnets in the world. Regular magnets lose magnetism at 175° F; Dimple's neodymium magnets are rated at over 300° F, so they continue to grab those destructive metal particles even when things get hot. In addition, Dimple's magnets degrade at the incredibly slow rate of ½ of 1% every 100 years, so they are guaranteed to work throughout your lifetime.

Most stock BMW motor mounts are fluid filled and the stiffness of the mount depends on this fluid. But over time the fluid leaks out and the strength of the mount is greatly reduced. A worn motor mount allows the engine to twist and shift around. The harder you're driving the more shift will occur. As the engine is moving around it can contact other parts in the engine bay - usually cooling related. The mechanical fan can hit the radiator; the A/C compressor can hit a radiator hose, the exhaust will flex and may break. Twisting of the engine can also lead to shifting problems as the transmission twists with it.

On a tuned 335i you may have noticed more driveline shudder or problems hooking up during hard launches. What happens is the stock rubber bushings are under constant flex as engine torque is transmitted through the differential. Under normal driving with a stock car the bushings are rarely stressed. But factor in significant additional torque from a tuned N54/N55 and the stock rubber will quickly show its weaknesses. You may have even broken a diff bolt or two as the heavy differential shifts around. Even non-turbo E82 and E9X models may benefit from fresh bushings.This is a set of stock rubber bushings, made by OEM supplier Lemforder. They are the same as the Genuine BMW E9X diff mount bushings, but without the more expensive branding. If you're turned off by potential side effects of urethane or Delrin then the OEM diff mounts are your best option. The OEM mounts fit and perform just like the originals so there is no second guessing their quality.

When the factory wanted to upgrade their motor mounts, this was the solution! The stock S14 motor mount is filled with fluid and a relatively soft rubber compound. This was designed to absorb vibration from the high strung S14 engine. But during hard track use the stock motor mounts can become a liability with the engine twisting and shifting around. BMW Motorsport's solution was to design a mount that is not fluid filled and solid rubber. The Group N mounts are 20% stiffer than the stock mounts which makes them perfect for weekend fun cars, autocross, and even light track use. Because it lacks a fluid for dampening, more vibration will make its way into the car. These mounts are the same height as the original stock mounts. Pricey? Maybe. But these are factory Motorsport parts that work as advertised. These motor mounts are widely regarded as among the best on the market for a motor mount upgrade. Combine these with the Group N transmission mounts for a matched set.   When doing any sort of repair or maintenance there is no replacement for genuine factory parts. Turner Motorsport carries the Genuine BMW brand with pride and has the parts you need to complete your next project with confidence.    .     1987-1991    M3"

The differential is part of the subframe, as it is a stress member system. When the subframe moves, so do all of the rear suspension mounting points. Replacing the stock rubber subframe bushings with solid aluminum will limit drivetrain and suspension movement and keep your car’s suspension geometry the way it’s supposed to be. The Delrin diff mount bushing is a near-solid mount that will last longer than the original rubber and does not 'wind up' under load/unload. This transfers more power through the axles to the wheels. The Turner Motorsport E30 solid subframe and differential mount bushing kit is a direct replacement for the stock BMW subframe mounts and differential bushing. We have incorporated ideas from our other race style solid bushings not only make these very light weight but also to be fully serviceable and removable in the case of subframe or diff cover replacement. This kit is a legal upgrade in many racing classes.    We also sell the Solid Differential mount and Subframe Mounts separately, for those that may already have one of the products or if you desire spares for fast installation. A common example is if you have two differentials with covers, and want to make fast gearing changes at the track.          1984-1991    318i 318is 318ic 325e 325es 325i 325ic 325is 325ix M3"
