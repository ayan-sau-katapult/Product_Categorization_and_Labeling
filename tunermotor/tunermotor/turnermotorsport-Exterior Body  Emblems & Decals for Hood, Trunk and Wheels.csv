This is an all-metal version of the regular BMW roundel emblem and more authentic to the original hood roundel found on 2002, E21, E23, E24, E28, and E30 models. This is an all-metal base with painted and polished face. There's an impressive quality feel and look to this metal roundel that the usual plastic replacement just can't touch. If you're an owner of a vintage 1970s-1980s BMW this is the only hood roundel you should have! This may fit other models as well, see our fitment drop-down guide at the bottom for more specifics.   There are some other major differences that vintage owners will appreciate:   + painted, not printed vinyl  + deep colors and lustre  + raised edges with more relief  + brightly polished metal  + heft and hand-crafted feel that you just don't get with plastic  + all of the same dimensions as the 51148132375 roundel   New hood grommets are supplied with this emblem. Note that these roundels appear to be hand-finished and may have minor blemishes in the paint. This is considered normal and in-line with expectations for a hand painted part.        BMW used this emblem in both locations on some cars but on some other models they may have used a different emblem in that location. See the fitment specifics in the drop-down below - this emblem may not fit all cars. If the emblem you need is not listed, see the rest of emblems for sale on our site.

There are 2 options to choose from Magnetic: Made from a 30mil thick magnetic sheet, these are easy to apply and keep clean, great for your daily driver that you plan to remove and reapply the panels to regularly. For vehicles with belt line moldings like the E46 and E36 these are not recommended for more then auto cross speed as the belt line does not allow them to sit flat against the door, for these cars we recommend the low-tac vinyl. Low Tac Vinyl: Great for vehicles with belt line moldings, aluminium, fiber glass/ carbon fiber body panels, made from a super thick gloss vinyl for easy removal and storage. Low tac vinyl can be used multiple times per season depending on care, perfect for the weekend or dedicated track cars that don't need to have the numbers removed after each event."
