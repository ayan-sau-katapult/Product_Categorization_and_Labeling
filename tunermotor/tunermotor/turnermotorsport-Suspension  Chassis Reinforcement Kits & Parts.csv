https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-91-e46-rear-chassissubframe-reinforcement-kit/,E46 Rear Chassis/Subframe Reinforcement Kit,91,TDR4675412,$107.21,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-87-bmw-reinforcement-kits#,"Updated in 2020 to provide additional reinforcement! The E46 rear driveline and suspension are very similar to that of the E36. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the E46 also shares some of the same problems as the E36. One of these problems is the rear mounting points for the subframe, which can rip out from their spots in the sheet metal. This happens because the rear differential transmits the torsional load from the engine through the subframe, then into the chassis. This constant loading and unloading weakens the sheet metal and causes it to fatigue and separate from the chassis. BMW tried to fix this problem in the E46 by placing a cross member on the front two mounting points of the subframe. This cross member keeps the front mounting points from having problems by placing the bushing and the stud in double-sheer, thus reducing the twisting action on the sheet metal. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the load from the front of the subframe now gets transmitted to the left rear of the subframe. This is where we have seen many failures of the chassis on low mileage street cars and race cars. BMW has also tried to prevent the issue by injecting foam into the open space between the underside of the chassis and the top of the trunk. This seems to work but that does not address the issues of the spot welds failing on the sheetmetal. It can also make any additional work there harder and almost impossible to weld against. Our reinforcement kit has proven over and over again to be effective and the easiest to work with in the long run.   This product reinforces the chassis sheet metal at the subframe mounting points. We do this by thickening the metal and distributing the load over a larger area. This kit will save time when repairing the chassis, and is also strongly recommended as a preventative maintenance item.           1999-2005    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi M3"

A modified suspension, however, puts more stress on that mount. Time is not kind to mounts either, especially when they're metal and have been exposed to the elements.

This reinforcement should be done on all non-M E36 models especially when used in track/autocross situations. The kit is a set of 4 plates that are added to reinforce the rear subframe chassis mounts. BMW discovered that over time, due to the bending of the rear of the chassis in conjunction with the movement allowed by the rubber bushings in the rear, the chassis mounting points for the subframe would flex, weaken, and if left unattended, rip out of the chassis. The stock mounts are basically a flat plate with an internally threaded tube that are welded to the chassis. The flex of the rear subframe causes the threaded tube and mounting bolt to act as a lever arm at the point where the flat plate is welded to the chassis, weakening the surrounding sheet metal. Due to the direction of force of the torque applied by the drivetrain on the subframe, the first mount to rip out is the passenger�s side front mount, followed by the drivers side rear mount. Having these plates welded to the underside of the chassis significantly stiffens the mounts and stops the weakening of them.   In order to weld these plates in, the rear suspension, rear subframe, exhaust, and driveshaft must be removed. It is also strongly recommended that the back seat, rear interior, trunk interior, and fuel tank are removed and all fuel lines are capped to reduce the fire hazard while welding.      1992-1998    318i 318is 323is 325i 325is 328i 328is  2/1994-6/1994    M3, although there is no clear transition on when the factory started building M3s with the reinforcements"
