On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade. This is where Two-Piece Floating rotors start to shine. Two-Piece rotors were designed specifically for high-performance applications and are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Needless to say, we aren't a fan of our track days being cut short due to braking issues, so we decided to create our very own performance-oriented TrackSport Rotors! Our TrackSport rotors feature a full floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. Features & Specifications: OE Fitment and Installation Two-Piece Fully Floating Design Heat-treated rotor rings for extended life and reduced wear Factory-applied coating prevents rust and corrosion Lightweight design eliminates excess rotational mass Slotted grooves expel brake dust and gases Internal vanes increase cooling and braking performance",,,,,,,,,,,

The CSL rotors are a full 30mm (1.18"") larger than the stock E36 M3 discs. The larger rotor puts out more braking torque and can handle more friction and heat than stock. With the special brackets these larger rotors are able to bolt-on to the E36 M3 hub using your original calipers and lines. Simply bolt them on using the new caliper bracket. The E36 M3 CSL upgrade is a moderate upgrade over stock compared to a StopTech or Brembo Big Brake Kit but has lower upfront cost, lower consumable cost (pads and rotors), and has a wide range of pad choices (any brake pad for an E36 M3 or E46 M3 will work).",Starting at,Stoptech (Centric) CSL/ZCP Cross-Drilled and Floating,Original M3 CSL/ZCP Cross-Drilled and Floating,ECS 2-piece Cross Drilled and Slotted Floating (pictured),"With more braking torque, the brake bias is changed. For the street, you will notice more stopping power and more ""bite"" from the front brakes. You may not notice the front brakes are working harder. If you're using this kit on the track it will be more important to balance the brake bias using different front-rear pad compounds. The front brakes will be doing more work than before to slow the car down and you will need to balance that with a more aggressive pad on the rear. You may notice the front tires locking up sooner, especially in wet conditions. Contact us to discuss track pads for your situation.","Wheel fitment: 18"" wheels are strongly recommended for brake clearance although some 17"" wheels will work (if they clear a BBK they will work with these)",,,,,

First, they are larger, moving the friction surface further away from the center, creating more surface area. This helps to alleviate heat soak issues that would be found on smaller rotors. Second, they have built in cooling designs that allow the rotors to cool down quicker in between braking. Cross drilling allows for better cooling as well as better pad contact by allowing gasses and break dust to pass through and directional veining improves cooling by forcing through and directing the air flow to reduce temperatures.","This CSL rotor conversion kit can be used with factory wheel sizes of 18"" and larger and any E46 M3 brake pad set can be used.",

At the heart of the system are the aluminum 6 piston fixed calipers and ventilated, cross-drilled rotors on the front. The design of these elements reflects their sporting origins, and the light weight of the system reduces the unsprung weight of the car, and so improves driving dynamics.     The BMW Performance front braking system performs particularly well in the wet - the grooves and holes in the discs prevent a film of water from forming between the brake disc and brake pad.

This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. When considering a brake rotor upgrade, it's important to factor in their specific use. On the road, a solid rotor is a simple, yet cheap and effective solution that is perfectly capable of handling daily-driver requirements. When you start taking your BMW to the track, things become a little more complicated. Extended periods of aggressive driving causes the amount of heat in the rotors to build up, and as the temperature of the rotors increase, the metal begins to expand. With solid rotors, this can lead to numerous issues such as warping of the rotors, unexpected cracking along the inner ""ring"" or friction surfaces, and increased brake fade.",,,,,,,,,,,

StopTech's Front Big Brake Kit for the 335i is engineered to work with the stock brake hydraulics and ABS/DSC system. StopTech builds each kit around the specific vehicle, engineering the system to achieve the correct brake balance. This brake upgrade gives better stopping performance in everyday driving, aggressive street driving, or all-out track days. By increasing the rotor size, using a larger pad, and a fixed forged aluminum caliper, you can improve your braking performance substantially for any condition! StopTech Brakes have been used on Turner Motorsport racecars since 2003, winning 5 sports car championships and recording numerous race wins since.+ Caliper design improves brake application and increases torque - + Vehicle-specific design - + Larger and thicker rotors - + extremely strong caliper and mounting system - reduces flex and deflection, improving torque application to the disc+ Several color options available+ Vehicle-specific calipers that maintain correct brake proportioning and balance+ AeroRotor patented vaning for superior air flow+ Cross-Drilled for street use or Gas-Slotted for street or track use+ Billet aluminum mounting hats for superior strength over steel+ DOT-compliant stainless steel brake lines+ Street Performance brake pads that work on both street and light track use Sounds obvious right? Many bolt-on caliper upgrades and other big brake kits are not built with the specific vehicle's dynamics in mind. With too much braking force on the front, rear traction is compromised. And vice-versa. Brake traction is better when all four tires are doing the work. Most BMWs have 50-50 weight distribution so the correct braking proportioning is crucial! StopTech engineers each kit around that vehicle's dynamics by altering the size and number of pistons in the caliper to match the rotor size used in the kit. Bigger is not always better…",Starting at,Caliper:,Brake Pad Buying Guide,Colors:,Rotors:,Also Included:,Safety Improvements from A Big Brake Kit:,braking is stronger meaning shorter stopping distances and faster response,Wheel spoke-to-brake caliper clearance is critical since the new caliper is physically larger and the in a different position. StopTech has produced these cutaway diagrams for you to print and place on the backside of your wheel to check for clearance. Wheels that do not clear will need a wheel spacer.

Many bolt-on caliper upgrades and other big brake kits are not built with the specific vehicle's dynamics in mind. With too much braking force on the front, rear traction is compromised. And vice-versa. Brake traction is better when all four tires are doing the work. Most BMWs have 50-50 weight distribution so the correct braking proportioning is crucial! StopTech engineers each kit around that vehicle's dynamics by altering the size and number of pistons in the caliper to match the rotor size used in the kit.

This is accomplished using StopTech's® patented bolt-in bridge, which is strong enough to stop distortion without sacrificing cooling through the top of the caliper. The patented 2-piece AeroRotors push more air thanks to curved, airfoil-shaped vanes and an air channel that widens at the trailing edge of the vanes. StopTech aluminum AeroHats are lighter and feature directional stand-offs between the rotor and mounting hat that increase airflow to the (hotter) outside face of the rotor by over 15%.

This is accomplished using StopTech's® patented bolt-in bridge, which is strong enough to stop distortion without sacrificing cooling through the top of the caliper. The patented 2-piece AeroRotors push more air thanks to curved, airfoil-shaped vanes and an air channel that widens at the trailing edge of the vanes. StopTech aluminum AeroHats are lighter and feature directional stand-offs between the rotor and mounting hat that increase airflow to the (hotter) outside face of the rotor by over 15%.

StopTech® 2-piece calipers have the lowest amount of flex and deflection among 25 of the leading caliper models (including some monoblocks) from well-known manufacturers. This is accomplished using StopTech's® patented bolt-in bridge, which is strong enough to stop distortion without sacrificing cooling through the top of the caliper. The patented 2-piece AeroRotors push more air thanks to curved, airfoil-shaped vanes and an air channel that widens at the trailing edge of the vanes. StopTech aluminum AeroHats are lighter and feature directional stand-offs between the rotor and mounting hat that increase airflow to the (hotter) outside face of the rotor by over 15%. Street Performance Brake Pads are included in all Big Brake Kits besides the track-only Trophy Race Big Brake Kits. StopTech Street Performance Pads are intended for high performance street driving as well as light duty track use.

StopTech® 2-piece calipers have the lowest amount of flex and deflection among 25 of the leading caliper models (including some monoblocks) from well-known manufacturers. This is accomplished using StopTech's® patented bolt-in bridge, which is strong enough to stop distortion without sacrificing cooling through the top of the caliper. The patented 2-piece AeroRotors push more air thanks to curved, airfoil-shaped vanes and an air channel that widens at the trailing edge of the vanes. StopTech aluminum AeroHats are lighter and feature directional stand-offs between the rotor and mounting hat that increase airflow to the (hotter) outside face of the rotor by over 15%.

This is accomplished using StopTech's® patented bolt-in bridge, which is strong enough to stop distortion without sacrificing cooling through the top of the caliper. The patented 2-piece AeroRotors push more air thanks to curved, airfoil-shaped vanes and an air channel that widens at the trailing edge of the vanes. StopTech aluminum AeroHats are lighter and feature directional stand-offs between the rotor and mounting hat that increase airflow to the (hotter) outside face of the rotor by over 15%.

StopTech's Rear Big Brake Kit for the E53 X5 is engineered to work with the stock brake hydraulics and ABS/DSC system. StopTech builds each kit around the specific vehicle, engineering the system to achieve the correct brake balance. This brake upgrade gives better stopping performance in everyday driving, aggressive street driving, or all-out track days. By increasing the rotor size, using a larger pad, and a fixed forged aluminum caliper, you can improve your braking performance substantially for any condition! StopTech Brakes have been used on Turner Motorsport racecars since 2003, winning 5 sports car championships and recording numerous race wins since.+ Caliper design improves brake application and increases torque - + Vehicle-specific design - + Larger and thicker rotors - + extremely strong caliper and mounting system - reduces flex and deflection, improving torque application to the disc+ Several color options available+ Vehicle-specific calipers that maintain correct brake proportioning and balance+ AeroRotor patented vaning for superior air flow+ Cross-Drilled for street use or Gas-Slotted for street or track use+ Billet aluminum mounting hats for superior strength over steel+ DOT-compliant stainless steel brake lines+ Street Performance brake pads that work on both street and light track use Sounds obvious right? Many bolt-on caliper upgrades and other big brake kits are not built with the specific vehicle's dynamics in mind. With too much braking force on the front, rear traction is compromised. And vice-versa. Brake traction is better when all four tires are doing the work. Most BMWs have 50-50 weight distribution so the correct braking proportioning is crucial! StopTech engineers each kit around that vehicle's dynamics by altering the size and number of pistons in the caliper to match the rotor size used in the kit. Bigger is not always betterBig brake kits have larger components than the factory brakes. Some wheel designs and sizes may not clear without wheel spacers. StopTech has produced a template that has all of the critical dimensions of this brake kit.",Starting at,Caliper:,Colors:,Rotors:,Also Included:,Safety Improvements from A Big Brake Kit:,braking is stronger meaning shorter stopping distances and faster response,improves brake feel with a firmer pedal,Brake FAQs,You can download and print it here and then check the clearance on your wheels.,2000-2006  X5 3.0i X5 4.4i

StopTech aluminum AeroHats are lighter, and feature directional stand-offs between the rotor and mounting hat that increase airflow to the (hotter) outside face of the rotor by over 15%. Features: Natural look Anodized caliper and rotor hat finish that resists fading and discoloration Patented Stoptech AeroRotors for optimized airflow Patented, billet aluminum AeroHats to further increase airflow Weight optimized StopTech STR calipers with patented bolt-in bridge StopTech stainless steel brake lines and race engineered caliper brackets Components made in the USA Full ISO/TS 16949:2009 certification",,,,,,,,,,,
