Where we can make our software better is by tuning it for higher octane gasoline. The stock software is tuned around the 87 octane available in the US (not that most people would use 87 but BMW engineers must account for that possibility). With our software, the performance of the S65 engine is optimized for the higher 91 or 93 octane. We tune many areas of the engine programming - fuel and timing maps at part throttle and wide-open throttle, revised torque settings and knock control, and more. The throttle response is also improved (quicker and smoother) eliminating unwanted and dangerous flat spots in the factory pedal response. We also offer raised rev limits and the top speed is raised/eliminated. Our software uses the factory 240E update as a base. The 240E has several major enhancements over previous factory file versions. No worry if you don't have 240E - we will provide you with a free update before the Turner performance software is installed. If you have other modifications done to your M3, we can supply you with specially-developed software to maximize the gains from those upgrades.Turner Motorsport has been developing software on the S65 since our first car in 2008. Since then we have done software projects for street, track, full-race, stroker, and supercharged engine builds using the stock MSS60 DME or a stand-alone Bosch or Motec system. Engine tunes have been developed and checked on our Dynapack chassis dyno and further refined with real world testing. Our software is installed via the Turner flashing OBD tool. This tool plugs into the OBD socket in the dash and the performance software is installed from a laptop computer connected to the tool. It also works as a fault code scanner to read and reset diagnostic trouble codes and reset adaptations. The software program requires a Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 laptop and the installation and setup are very easy . The OBD tool, cable, and files are shipped to you with simple setup instructions. There is no need to remove your ECU and ship it. You can have your M3 flashed in under an hour from the convenience of your garage or driveway!",,2008-2011  M3 - Sedan2008-2013  M3 - Coupe2008-2013  M3 - Convertible,240E Update,This item fits the following BMWs:,E90 BMW,E92 BMW,E93 BMW,

Peak horsepower gain up to = +34 hp Peak torque gain up to = +29 ft-lbs Decades of tuning for the street and track has helped us understand what's important to the MINI tuning community - highly effective, reliable, consistent performance tuning that heightens the MINI Cooper driving experience. Hours of testing and retesting calibrations on our in-house Mustang dyno to ensure we were delivering a tune that is offers the desired driving experience and is compatible with 100% stock cars, as well as those with common bolt-on modifications. What modifications do I need? In short: none! Our tune is optimized for factory stock cars, as well as those with light modifications such as intake or cat-back exhaust. An intercooler is also supported - and is recommended for cars that see driving environments that frequently cause heat-soak. Our N14 tune removes the factory speed limiter, raises the rev limiter to 6900rpm, and will offer full power at 93 octane (although is compatible with 91 octane as well). Our modified calibrations offer significant peak power gains of +34 horsepower and +29 ft-lbs torque (with max gains of 38 horsepower and 38 ft-lbs torque). Your MINI Cooper S will pull harder all the way to redline - sure to put a smile on your face. How do I get my tune? Easily, and in your own garage or driveway. No wiring changes, no irreversible modifications, no need to even open the hood. We mail you a DIY flashing tool and step-by-step instructions, you download your stock tune using a Windows laptop, and upload it to us while also answering a few easy questions. We quickly get to work creating your tune and email it back to you, for you to install (by following easy step-by-step instructions) at your convenience. There is no downtime - you can still drive your car while we process your tune. See install and tuning instructions here, and access the latest install licenses. What else do I need to know? Maintenance. The key to building a high performance machine is regular maintenance and upkeep. We've found regular ignition system service to be of significant importance - replace your spark plugs at 25,000 mile intervals for best results, and replace your ignition coils with every other spark plug replacement. Dealer service. After tuning, there's the possibility your local dealer may over-write your tune if they update your engine's software. This simply requires reloading of the Turner tune after your service visit. We find many dealers to be accommodating of our software - simply letting your service adviser know your car has been tuned is often enough to avoid an unnecessary software update.
