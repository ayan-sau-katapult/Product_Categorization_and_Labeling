    ...",363172,MMTSE3692,$49.95,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-845-bmw-thermostats#,"The thermostat regulates the temperature of your coolant. At a predetermined temperature the thermostat will open to let coolant flow to the radiator and be cooled by airflow or the fan. Over time the thermostat will become stuck open or closed, leading to a variety of issues. A closed thermostat will never allow the coolant to reach the radiator and be cooled. Hot coolant will continue to circulate through the engine and absorb even more heat until boiling and the system overheats. An open thermostat is not as bad but is still not ideal - the coolant is always cool, with the temp needle always reading in the cool range. This tells the ECU to richen the fuel mixture to bring the car up to normal operating temp. So your fuel mileage decreases and the car runs rich.  Replacing the thermostat is an easy but messy job. This thermostat includes the main o-ring (but a housing gasket may be required). Consider replacing the housing and any associated temp sensors while you're in there. The cooling system will need to be bled after.  Most of the engines from the mid-1980s through the 1990s use the same thermostat design and they are interchangeable among the different temperatures. This is the 68*C thermostat, at the bottom of the temperature range. It should only be used in racing situations such as when deleting the engine fan. However, keep in mind that BMW spent a lot of time engineering the cooling system to work in all kinds of conditions and changing thermostat temperature is not recommended to fix any failures in the cooling system."

This can save you money if the pump still has life left on it but the thermostat needs to be done now. Symptoms of a bad thermostat include an erratic temp gauge and a fault code. When replacing the thermostat, there are three o-rings that will likely need to be replaced between the thermostat and the water pump housing, and two on the coolant tube going to the head. We also recommend new hoses, clamps, and BMW coolant. Replacement should take about one hour.   Note: even though this can be done without replacing the water pump, the job involves removing the same items to access this area. And opening the thermostat housing will spill a lot of coolant. In other words, if you don't replace the water pump at the same time, you're going to repeat this process when the pump needs replacing. We offer a complete water pump overhaul package that covers everything you need if you want to it all at once. You can the thermostat to that package and get everything without any duplicate parts.     On S54 engines (E46 M3, MZ3, Z4 M) there is a flanged head bolt going into the cylinder head, behind the thermostat cover. This holds the left side timing chain guide rail in place and if it's loose or falls out you could have a very serious engine failure to deal with. Make sure to check this bolt while you have the thermostat cover off. You only need to make sure it's tight. But if it's come loose you may want to replace the seal ring and use a small touch of oil-resistant thread sealer.     2000-2001    M3 M3 Convertible 2000-2006  2001-2002    Z3 M Roadster Z3 M Coupe w S54 Engine  2006-2008    Z4 M Roadster Z4 M Coupe"

At a predetermined temperature the thermostat will open to let coolant flow to the radiator and be cooled by airflow or the fan. Over time the thermostat will become stuck open or closed, leading to a variety of issues. A closed thermostat will never allow the coolant to reach the radiator and be cooled. Hot coolant will continue to circulate through the engine and absorb even more heat until boiling and the system overheats. An open thermostat is not as bad but is still not ideal - the coolant is always cool, with the temp needle always reading in the cool range. This tells the ECU to richen the fuel mixture to bring the car up to normal operating temp. So your fuel mileage decreases and the car runs rich.Replacing the thermostat is an easy but messy job. This thermostat includes the main o-ring (but a housing gasket may be required). Consider replacing the housing and any associated temp sensors while you're in there. The cooling system will need to be bled after.Most of the engines from the mid-1980s through the 1990s use the same thermostat design and they are interchangeable among the different temperatures. This is the 88* thermostat, towards the top of the range. However, keep in mind that BMW spent a lot of time engineering the cooling system to work in all kinds of conditions and changing thermostat temperature is not recommended to fix any failures in the cooling system."

Forged to exact factory tolerances, everything fits and this unit is a true easy bolt-on – especially suited for racing or load conditions like heavy traffic, where engine temp can rise rapidly. The housing is guaranteed never to break from overheating or over-tightening, and its CNC machined surface ensures a precise seat.

At a predetermined temperature the thermostat will open to let coolant flow to the radiator and be cooled by airflow or the fan. Over time the thermostat will become stuck open or closed, leading to a variety of issues. A closed thermostat will never allow the coolant to reach the radiator and be cooled. Hot coolant will continue to circulate through the engine and absorb even more heat until boiling and the system overheats. An open thermostat is not as bad but is still not ideal - the coolant is always cool, with the temp needle always reading in the cool range. This tells the ECU to richen the fuel mixture to bring the car up to normal operating temp. So your fuel mileage decreases and the car runs rich.   Replacing the thermostat is an easy but messy job. This thermostat includes the main o-ring (but a housing gasket may be required). Consider replacing the housing and any associated temp sensors while you're in there. The cooling system will need to be bled after.   Most of the engines from the mid-1980s through the 1990s use the same thermostat design and they are interchangeable among the different temperatures. This is the 80* thermostat, towards the lower end of the range. However, keep in mind that BMW spent a lot of time engineering the cooling system to work in all kinds of conditions and changing thermostat temperature is not recommended to fix any failures in the cooling system.     1977-1983    323i   1986-1991    318is 318ic 325e 325es 325i 325ic 325is 325ix  1992-1999    318i 318is 318ti 318ic 323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3  1982-1988    528e  1986-1988    535i  1989-1995    525i 535i  1997-1998    528i  1986-1989    635csi  1988-1994    735i 735il  1997-2000    Z3 2.8 M Roadster M Coupe"
