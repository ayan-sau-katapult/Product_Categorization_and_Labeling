Loose bolts should never happen! If you are a do-it-youselfer, or do much wrench turning, then you know about threadlocker (generically known as ""locktite"" or by the brand name Loctite). You also know a little goes a long way. This small bottle of Palm Labs Turbo-Lock blue threadlock is perfect for that small job -- or a few small jobs! This tube has 10 mL (0.34 fluid ounces) of moderate temp, medium-strength threadlocker. This bottle comes with two ways to apply: with a squeeze or with the included brush. There are just too many different uses for this, and no mechanic or DIYer, should be without some in his or her toolbox.   Red or Blue threadlocker? Red is the highest strength so use it when the fastener will not be removed regularly or ever again. The Red will need a great amount of force to break free and maybe even heat. Blue is the medium strength and will break free with hand tools. Use it for fasteners that need extra locking protection but will be removed / disassmebled on a semi-regular basis.

Once the surface is completely dry, KBS Klean can be used with any other paints or sealants. We use Klean everywhere around our shop - wiping down tools, engine bays, in our parts washer, the shop floor, painted and bare sheetmetal, and even some wheels.   Klean is also part of the 3-step process to neutralize rust. Apply it to a rusty panel and it will strip away grease and other contaminants in preparation for rust conversion and coating. Rinse the panel and let it dry and it's ready for the next step. An oxygen-blocking additive offers corrosion protection for up to 30 days."
