Pagani, Ducati and Kawasaki. Over time, thanks to extensive R&D, testing, and tuning, their products have evolved into some of the highest quality suspension systems in the world, providing years of flawless operation on both the street and the track. Ohlins' latest automotive suspension system, the DFV (Dual Flow Valve) Road and Track Coilover Kit, has bridged the gap between comfortable stock suspension and track focused coilover kits. These kits provide a ride that glides over typical bumps and dips in the road, all without the typical hard rattle and harsh feel of usual coilovers, and turn in tight and maintain tire grip and traction in corners significantly better than stock suspension ever could. This is all thanks to the spring rate chosen and Ohlins and their signature Dual Flow Valve. The DFV maintains comfort and agility by giving the same characteristics for both rebound and compression, allowing the wheel and tire to maintain constant contact with the road/track for maximum control. The Dual Flow Valve works by controlling shock fluid flow based on resistance and impact velocity. This is controlled in both compression and rebound, giving the quick shock operation that helps maintain traction. At low shaft travel speeds, oil flows mostly through the shaft jet bleed. At higher shaft speeds, oil flows mostly through the compression/rebound ports in the piston. At very high shaft speeds, or during sudden accelerations from potholes or large bumps in the road, oil can then escape through the ports in the DFV, absorbing a large amount of energy that would otherwise throw off the balance and control of the vehicle and keeping the tire planted firmly on the ground. With all three compression and rebound ports working together according to pressure and shaft speed, the result is the notorious premium suspension feel that only Ohlins can offer. In addition to managing the rebound and compression control, coilovers must also properly address heat changes in the shock oil. As the shock is pushed harder and longer, the oil quickly heats up due to friction and compression, and the oils flow characteristics change. The hotter the oil is, the easier it is for it to travel through ports and valves. To prevent this typical fade in control, Ohlins has implemented a temperature controlled needle bleed valve system that will expand as temperatures rise, slowly increasing restriction in the fluids flow through the valve gap. This produces a consistent dampening rate that maintains the vehicle's suspension characteristics lap after lap, turn after turn, no matter how hard you push your suspension's capabilities.

Pagani, Ducati and Kawasaki. Over time, thanks to extensive R&D, testing, and tuning, their products have evolved into some of the highest quality suspension systems in the world, providing years of flawless operation on both the street and the track. Ohlins' latest automotive suspension system, the DFV (Dual Flow Valve) Road and Track Coilover Kit, has bridged the gap between comfortable stock suspension and track focused coilover kits. These kits provide a ride that glides over typical bumps and dips in the road, all without the typical hard rattle and harsh feel of usual coilovers, and turn in tight and maintain tire grip and traction in corners significantly better than stock suspension ever could. This is all thanks to the spring rate chosen and Ohlins and their signature Dual Flow Valve. The DFV maintains comfort and agility by giving the same characteristics for both rebound and compression, allowing the wheel and tire to maintain constant contact with the road/track for maximum control. The Dual Flow Valve works by controlling shock fluid flow based on resistance and impact velocity. This is controlled in both compression and rebound, giving the quick shock operation that helps maintain traction. At low shaft travel speeds, oil flows mostly through the shaft jet bleed. At higher shaft speeds, oil flows mostly through the compression/rebound ports in the piston. At very high shaft speeds, or during sudden accelerations from potholes or large bumps in the road, oil can then escape through the ports in the DFV, absorbing a large amount of energy that would otherwise throw off the balance and control of the vehicle and keeping the tire planted firmly on the ground. With all three compression and rebound ports working together according to pressure and shaft speed, the result is the notorious premium suspension feel that only Ohlins can offer. In addition to managing the rebound and compression control, coilovers must also properly address heat changes in the shock oil. As the shock is pushed harder and longer, the oil quickly heats up due to friction and compression, and the oils flow characteristics change. The hotter the oil is, the easier it is for it to travel through ports and valves. To prevent this typical fade in control, Ohlins has implemented a temperature controlled needle bleed valve system that will expand as temperatures rise, slowly increasing restriction in the fluids flow through the valve gap. This produces a consistent dampening rate that maintains the vehicle's suspension characteristics lap after lap, turn after turn, no matter how hard you push your suspension's capabilities.

A new setting is just a click away, allowing you to set a ride and handling combination that works for your setting. Instead of offering too many shock settings that you're never going to use, Bilstein has chosen ten optimal damping curves from a smooth street setting (P10) to an ultra-stiff track-only setup (P1). Shock changes are made from an easy-to-use over-sized adjuster knob. are done from perches that ride on each shock body, which are zinc coated for excellent wear and corrosion resistance. You can set the ride height between 0.5 to 1.3 inches lower than stock ride height.

These are stiffer than most coil over kit manufacturers and the results of Bilstein's extensive testing on the German Nurgburgring and Autobahn. is just like a standard shock and spring package. The front struts and rear shocks are compatible with the stock strut and shock mounts. You can re-use your own or choose a mount with additional features. Because the Bilstein design keeps the sway bar tab in the original location, you can re-use the stock sway bar links. Using the stock mounts keeps the cost and complexity down and allows for TUV certification. You can also be assured of the stock mount's quiet and long-lasting performance. The assembly of the front strut is the same as a the factory strut. In the rear, ride height is made by an adjustable spring perch that sits under the rear spring.

The upper shock/strut mounts are all constructed of 6061-T6 Aluminum for strength and weight savings. BC Racing design 1 of 3 types of upper mounts for each vehicle: Caster/Camber Plates (+/- 3* camber), Camber Plates (+/- 3* camber), and Rubber Mount Plates (NVH reduction). The included mount option for this kit is shown in the kit specs and features below. Lower shock mounts are powder coated for corrosion protection and constructed of either 6061-T6 aluminum that has been milled from a single piece (fork or bolt eye mount) or of STKM13C steel with all brackets welded robotically. The included springs come in one of 3 styles: linear, S-barrel, and V-barrel. Linear springs are used in most applications unless limited by the OE design that does not allow the use of linear springs. All spring options are made from SAE9254 steel and have a zinc coating applied under the powder coating for increased spring corrosion protection and long term reliability. All shock bodies used in the BR Series coilovers use a 53mm shock body (unless noted otherwise) for added strength, performance, and increased fluid capacity. All shocks are then powder coated black chrome for clean styling and corrosion protection.

The E46 PSS10 kit is one of the most impressive suspensions on the market for performance and quality. Bilstein has engineered this kit to be functional and specific to the E46 chassis and not overloaded with features and bullet points that you'll never use. With the PSS10 you get 10 damper settings with meaningful differences between clicks, ride height adjustment, TUV certified quality and performance, a limited lifetime warranty, and easy fitment with stock mounts and links.    Bilstein PSS10 dampers feature their latest monotube design - a single large piston that performs better and lasts longer than other twin-tube designs. They also use a patented digressive valving system that helps give their shocks a better ride at any shock setting compared to competitor's progressive shocks. The PSS10 features 10    damper positions for rebound and compression - not hundreds of settings that you don't need or will never use. The settings range from 10 (softest) to 1 (stiffest) with meaningful variations between settings. This allows you to easily find a shock stiffness that best suits your driving environment and less wasted time trying separate adjustments and getting nowhere. The Bilstein PSS10 settings follow damper graphs and plots determined from their years of German performance tuning, including testing on the famed Nurburgring and Autobahn. Each setting is selected from a super-large knob at the bottom of each strut and shock - easily accessible from underneath the car. Each front strut is zinc coated for excellent wear resistance.   This kit is designed to lower the car between 1.0"" and 1.75"" from the original stock, non-sport package suspension. This allows you to set your ride height to suit your personal tastes, lower the center of gravity and roll center, and for a more aggressive appearance. Bilstein supplies springs with a front progressiverate of 400lb and a rear progressive rate of 455lb. The progressive rate means the spring starts its compression at a softer rate but will quickly stiffen as the spring is compressed. This is ideal for street driving as the ride stays compliant over daily bumps and impacts while stiffening for more extreme cornering. Each spring is a 60mm ID so some hardware is already in place for a change to different springs. Front height adjustment is made via the perches on the coil over strut. The reat height is made from an adjustable perch mounted on top of the spring. The stock upper front strut mounts, rear upper shock mounts, and stock front sway bar links are used for installation. This keeps the cost low and installation easy! And it means replacement parts are easily obtained from multiple suppliers (not a kit-specific part that will be hard to source).   The Bilstein PSS10 kit remains one of our favorite suspensions for an E46 simply because it works so well as an over-achieving street suspension. It's engineering greatly surpasses a regular shock/spring package and the quality surpasses many of the other aftermarket performance coil overs we see. This is our #1 choice for our customers who want a capable street suspension.   Alternate Bilstein part number: 48-126380     1999-2005    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 328i 328ci 330i 330ci",,,,,,

Pagani, Ducati, and Kawasaki. Over time, thanks to extensive R&D, testing, and tuning, their products have evolved into some of the highest quality suspension systems in the world, providing years of flawless operation on both the street and the track. Ohlins' latest automotive suspension system, the DFV (Dual Flow Valve) Road and Track Coilover Kit, has bridged the gap between comfortable stock suspension and track-focused coilover kits. These kits provide a ride that glides over typical bumps and dips in the road, all without the typical hard rattle and harsh feel of usual coilovers, and turn in tight and maintain tire grip and traction in corners significantly better than stock suspension ever could. This is all thanks to the spring rate chosen and Ohlins and their signature Dual Flow Valve. The DFV maintains comfort and agility by giving the same characteristics for both rebound and compression, allowing the wheel and tire to maintain constant contact with the road/track for maximum control. The Dual Flow Valve works by controlling shock fluid flow based on resistance and impact velocity. This is controlled in both compression and rebound, giving the quick shock operation that helps maintain traction. At low shaft travel speeds, oil flows mostly through the shaft jet bleed. At higher shaft speeds, oil flows mostly through the compression/rebound ports in the piston. At very high shaft speeds, or during sudden accelerations from potholes or large bumps in the road, oil can then escape through the ports in the DFV, absorbing a large amount of energy that would otherwise throw off the balance and control of the vehicle and keeping the tire planted firmly on the ground. With all three compression and rebound ports working together according to pressure and shaft speed, the result is the notorious premium suspension feel that only Ohlins can offer. In addition to managing the rebound and compression control, coilovers must also properly address heat changes in the shock oil. As the shock is pushed harder and longer, the oil quickly heats up due to friction and compression, and the oils flow characteristics change. The hotter the oil is, the easier it is for it to travel through ports and valves. To prevent this typical fade-in control, Ohlins has implemented a temperature-controlled needle bleed valve system that will expand as temperatures rise, slowly increasing restriction in the fluids flow through the valve gap. This produces a consistent dampening rate that maintains the vehicle's suspension characteristics lap after lap, turn after turn, no matter how hard you push your suspension's capabilities.

These are among the easiest coil over kits on the market - no special mounts required (works with stock mounts and sway bar links), larger adjustment knob allows for easy shock damping changes, and coil over spanner wrenches included for easy height changes. Bilstein backs up their technology with a limited lifetime warranty. TUV approved for fitment, safety, and quality! dampers in the PSS10 offer 10 precise settings for compression and rebound. A new setting is just a click away, allowing you to set a ride and handling combination that works for your setting. Instead of offering too many shock settings that you're never going to use, Bilstein has chosen ten optimal damping curves from a smooth street setting (P10) to an ultra-stiff track-only setup (P1). Shock changes are made from an easy-to-use over-sized adjuster knob. are done from perches that ride on each shock body, which are zinc coated for excellent wear and corrosion resistance. You can set the ride height between 0.5 to 1.3 inches lower than stock ride height. Springs are progressively rated so their initial compression rating is quite soft and then becomes stiffer as the spring compresses. These are stiffer than most coil over kit manufacturers and the results of Bilstein's extensive testing on the German Nurgburgring and Autobahn. is just like a standard shock and spring package. The front struts and rear shocks are compatible with the stock strut and shock mounts. You can re-use your own or choose a mount with additional features. Because the Bilstein design keeps the sway bar tab in the original location, you can re-use the stock sway bar links. Using the stock mounts keeps the cost and complexity down and allows for TUV certification. You can also be assured of the stock mount's quiet and long-lasting performance. The assembly of the front strut is the same as a the factory strut. In the rear, ride height is made by an adjustable spring perch that sits under the rear spring. Install instructions and diagrams included.If you're looking for a supremely capable and high quality suspension, then look no further than the Bilstein PSS10.

The PSS kit features height-adjustable springs paired with performance-tuned monotube shock absorbers. It's better than the standard sport shock/spring package thanks to its adjustable ride height and matched shock and spring rates. With a lower ride height and stiffer springs you get less bodyroll and better handling. These are the most user-friendly coil over kits on the market - no special mounts required (works with stock 540/M5 mounts) and coil over spanner wrenches included for easy height changes. Bilstein backs up their technology with a limited lifetime warranty. TUV approved for fitment, safety, and quality!     are matched to the progressive-rate springs and tuned for performance. The PSS does not have the adjustable shock settings like the PSS9. Instead the damping is set at a performance level. Bilstein features a monotube shock design in this kit - one large shock piston instead of two smaller pistons. The larger piston is better at dissipating heat and controlling small shock movements. The rest of the shock is identical to the more expensive PSS9 - zinc coated shock bodies, aluminum spring seats and lock collars, fine rounded threads for precise height adjustments, and tuned progressive-rate springs.     Ride height adjustments are done from perches on the bottom of each spring. You can set the ride height between 1.0 to 2.0 inches lower than stock ride height. On the E39 we recommend a front to rear rake of .75"" (higher rear). Bilstein uses progressive-rate springs to keep the ride smooth yet sporty. Overall, the PSS springs are stiffer than other coil over kits and the results of Bilstein's extensive testing on the German Nurgburgring and Autobahn. Rear shocks are also coil over, just like the factory shocks. The struts are zinc coated for excellent wear and corrosion resistance.     of these is just like a standard shock and spring package. The front struts and rear shocks are compatible with the stock mounts. On the front, Bilstein has an ingenious upper spring perch that allows you to retain the stock spring radial bearing. We recommend getting new front upper bearings. Using the stock mounts keeps the cost and complexity down and allows for TUV certification. You can also be assured of the stock mount's quiet and long-lasting performance.    is the same as the factory strut, except you use the Bilstein upper spring perch in place of the stock perch.

To ensure performance, comfort, and quality, all BR Series kits are Dyno tested during the design stage to determine the best valving and spring rates, then installed and tested for a minimum of 6 months. This kit features mounts and brackets that are fully compatible with all stock mounting points and components. The upper shock/strut mounts are all constructed of 6061-T6 Aluminum for strength and weight savings. BC Racing design 1 of 3 types of upper mounts for each vehicle: Caster/Camber Plates (+/- 3* camber), Camber Plates (+/- 3* camber), and Rubber Mount Plates (NVH reduction). The included mount option for this kit is shown in the kit specs and features below. Lower shock mounts are powder coated for corrosion protection and constructed of either 6061-T6 aluminum that has been milled from a single piece (fork or bolt eye mount) or of STKM13C steel with all brackets welded robotically. The included springs come in one of 3 styles: linear, S-barrel, and V-barrel. Linear springs are used in most applications unless limited by the OE design that does not allow the use of linear springs. All spring options are made from SAE9254 steel and have a zinc coating applied under the powder coating for increased spring corrosion protection and long term reliability. All shock bodies used in the BR Series coilovers use a 53mm shock body (unless noted otherwise) for added strength, performance, and increased fluid capacity. All shocks are then powder coated black chrome for clean styling and corrosion protection.

The RideControl is a performance coil over system combined with EDC technology for cars that were not available with EDC from the factory. Now you can choose your suspension stiffness on the fly along with the benefits of a Bilstein PSS coil over!   An EDC (Electronic Damping Control) system uses an electronic control module wired to each shock absorber to vary the stiffness of the shock. With the Bilstein B16 kit you can choose between a primary Comfort setting or a stiffer Sport setting via a dash mounted button. You can leave it in Comfort for around-town running and instantly get a tighter and more responsive suspension for twisty country roads. The Comfort setting is also dynamic - sensing road characteristics and g-forces to instantaneously firm the suspension when you're pushing the car, just like a factory installed EDC system. This is the ultimate E60 suspension!   The basic kit is a Bilstein PSS system with true coil over front struts, rear shocks, four springs, height adjusters, and the EDC module, wiring, and button. The front struts are zinc coated for superior corrosion resistance. The system installs just like a normal suspension and uses the factory original front upper strut mounts. You can choose to mount the EDC control module anywhere in the car (we chose the trunk floor) and then plug the harness into each shock and mount your button in the dash. Ride height can be set from 1.0""-1.75"" lower than stock. Installation instructions included but professional installation is strongly recommended. This kit is TUV certified and a limited lifetime warranty from Bilstein covers the entire kit.     2006-2010    M6",,,,,,

The PSS10 kit is one of the most impressive suspensions on the market for performance and quality. Bilstein has engineered this kit to be functional and specific to the F2X/F3X chassis and not overloaded with features and bullet points that you'll never use. With the PSS10 you get 10 damper settings with meaningful differences between clicks, ride height adjustment, TUV certified quality and performance, a limited lifetime warranty, and easy fitment with stock mounts and links.   Bilstein PSS10 dampers feature their latest monotube design - a single large piston that performs better and lasts longer than other twin-tube designs. They also use a patented digressive valving system that helps give their shocks a better ride at any shock setting compared to competitor's progressive shocks. The PSS10 features 10 useful damper positions for rebound and compression - not hundreds of settings that you don't need or will never use. The settings range from 10 (softest) to 1 (stiffest) with meaningful variations between settings. This allows you to easily find a shock stiffness that best suits your driving environment and less wasted time trying separate adjustments and getting nowhere. The Bilstein PSS10 settings follow damper graphs and plots determined from their years of German performance tuning, including testing on the famed Nurburgring and Autobahn. Each setting is selected from a super-large knob at the bottom of each strut and shock - easily accessible from underneath the car. Each front strut is zinc coated for excellent wear resistance.   The Bilstein PSS10 kit remains one of our favorite suspensions simply because it works so well as an over-achieving street suspension. It's engineering greatly surpasses a regular shock/spring package and the quality surpasses many of the other aftermarket performance coil overs we see. This is our #1 choice for our customers who want a capable street suspension.      2016+  228i xDrive, 230i xDrive  2013+  320i xDrive, 328i xDrive, 335i xDrive, 330i xDrive, 340i xDrive  2014+    428i xDrive, 435i xDrive, 430i xDrive, 440i xDrive,",,,,,,

This gives you the opportunity to upgrade your vehicle with an adaptive damper systen and electronically control the level of performance or comfort that meets your requirements Included in the package is a KW “inox-line” coilover suspension with high-quality stainless steel struts, electronically adjustable dampers, a high-performance control unit with a vehicle-specific set of cables, a KW DDC control button giving you control from the comfort of the drivers seat, and elaborate assembly instructions for an easy installation. The KW DDC ECU Coilover suspension features three vehicle-specific damper setups. At the touch of a button, you can choose between the basic Sport setting, a very sporty and performance-oriented Sport+ setup or Comfort mode. With the KW DDC button, the respective driving mode, Comfort, Sport, or Sport+ can be selected changing the adaptive KW DDC ECU coilover kit damper setting within milliseconds. In Sport+ mode, the adaptive KW dampers give every car an unadulterated driving behavior. A setup which is ideal for demanding rides on twisty roads with lots of load changes. The Sport mode, however, is perfect for driving on the highway with long curves, while the Comfort mode is the ideal for traveling on poorly developed roads. In Comfort mode, the suspension adjusts automatically to the respective driving situation. You are not buying a mass-produced, generic coilover kit, a KW coilover has been developed specifically for your particular vehicle. As a manufacturer, KW uses only its own resources, high-quality components and the damper technology that has all developed in-house. With the KW DDC coilovers, the rolling motion of the body will be reduced during compression giving you the benefit of more direct handling and confidence while driving.

These are among the easiest coil over kits on the market - no special mounts required (works with stock mounts and sway bar links), larger adjustment knob allows for easy shock damping changes, and coil over spanner wrenches included for easy height changes. Bilstein backs up their technology with a limited lifetime warranty. TUV approved for fitment, safety, and quality! dampers in the PSS9 offer 9 precise settings for compression and rebound. A new setting is just a click away, allowing you to set a ride and handling combination that works for your setting. Instead of offering too many shock settings that you're never going to use, Bilstein has chosen ten optimal damping curves from a smooth street setting (P9) to an ultra-stiff track-only setup (P1). Shock changes are made from an easy-to-use over-sized adjuster knob. are done from perches that ride on each shock body, which are zinc coated for excellent wear and corrosion resistance. You can set the ride height between 0.5 to 1.3 inches lower than stock ride height. Springs are progressively rated so their initial compression rating is quite soft and then becomes stiffer as the spring compresses. These are stiffer than most coil over kit manufacturers and the results of Bilstein's extensive testing on the German Nurgburgring and Autobahn. is just like a standard shock and spring package. The front struts and rear shocks are compatible with the stock strut and shock mounts. You can re-use your own or choose a mount with additional features. Because the Bilstein design keeps the sway bar tab in the original location, you can re-use the stock sway bar links. Using the stock mounts keeps the cost and complexity down and allows for TUV certification. You can also be assured of the stock mount's quiet and long-lasting performance. The assembly of the front strut is the same as a the factory strut. In the rear, ride height is made by an adjustable spring perch that sits under the rear spring. Install instructions and diagrams included.If you're looking for a supremely capable and high quality suspension, then look no further than the Bilstein PSS9.

H&R has designed this premium coil over specifically for the 1M using new materials and features not found on a typical 135 or M3 kit. The key features of this kit are the aluminum rear shocks with solid, Heim-joined lower mounts. The lighter weight from the aluminum and the free motion from the lower monoball makes for a more efficient shock motion and better response from the suspension. Combine these with our monoball upper shock mounts and you have race-bred shock technology for the ultimate BMW driver's car. H&R finely-tuned the rear shock dampening to reduce wheel hop. The wheel hop is inherent in the 1M and these H&R rear shocks go a long way in eliminating it. The front struts are a true nickel-plated, threaded body replacement for the stock strut. All four progressive-rate springs are included and rear aluminum ride height adjusters complete the set. You'll find this kit on H&R's own Project 1M so it has been dialed in by some of the best suspension engineers in Germany and the USA.These 1M Coil Overs are height adjustable in the front and rear using spring perches associated with each spring.

This gives you the opportunity to upgrade your vehicle with an adaptive damper systen and electronically control the level of performance or comfort that meets your requirements Included in the package is a KW “inox-line” coilover suspension with high-quality stainless steel struts, electronically adjustable dampers, a high-performance control unit with a vehicle-specific set of cables, a KW DDC control button giving you control from the comfort of the drivers seat, and elaborate assembly instructions for an easy installation. The KW DDC ECU Coilover suspension features three vehicle-specific damper setups. At the touch of a button, you can choose between the basic Sport setting, a very sporty and performance-oriented Sport+ setup or Comfort mode. With the KW DDC button, the respective driving mode, Comfort, Sport, or Sport+ can be selected changing the adaptive KW DDC ECU coilover kit damper setting within milliseconds. In Sport+ mode, the adaptive KW dampers give every car an unadulterated driving behavior. A setup which is ideal for demanding rides on twisty roads with lots of load changes. The Sport mode, however, is perfect for driving on the highway with long curves, while the Comfort mode is the ideal for traveling on poorly developed roads. In Comfort mode, the suspension adjusts automatically to the respective driving situation. You are not buying a mass-produced, generic coilover kit, a KW coilover has been developed specifically for your particular vehicle. As a manufacturer, KW uses only its own resources, high-quality components and the damper technology that has all developed in-house. With the KW DDC coilovers, the rolling motion of the body will be reduced during compression giving you the benefit of more direct handling and confidence while driving.",,,,,,For vehicles without EDC

Pagani, Ducati, and Kawasaki. Over time, thanks to extensive R&D, testing, and tuning, their products have evolved into some of the highest quality suspension systems in the world, providing years of flawless operation on both the street and the track. Ohlins' latest automotive suspension system, the DFV (Dual Flow Valve) Road and Track Coilover Kit, has bridged the gap between comfortable stock suspension and track-focused coilover kits. These kits provide a ride that glides over typical bumps and dips in the road, all without the typical hard rattle and harsh feel of usual coilovers, and turn in tight and maintain tire grip and traction in corners significantly better than stock suspension ever could. This is all thanks to the spring rate chosen and Ohlins and their signature Dual Flow Valve. The DFV maintains comfort and agility by giving the same characteristics for both rebound and compression, allowing the wheel and tire to maintain constant contact with the road/track for maximum control. The Dual Flow Valve works by controlling shock fluid flow based on resistance and impact velocity. This is controlled in both compression and rebound, giving the quick shock operation that helps maintain traction. At low shaft travel speeds, oil flows mostly through the shaft jet bleed. At higher shaft speeds, oil flows mostly through the compression/rebound ports in the piston. At very high shaft speeds, or during sudden accelerations from potholes or large bumps in the road, oil can then escape through the ports in the DFV, absorbing a large amount of energy that would otherwise throw off the balance and control of the vehicle and keeping the tire planted firmly on the ground. With all three compression and rebound ports working together according to pressure and shaft speed, the result is the notorious premium suspension feel that only Ohlins can offer. In addition to managing the rebound and compression control, coilovers must also properly address heat changes in the shock oil. As the shock is pushed harder and longer, the oil quickly heats up due to friction and compression, and the oils flow characteristics change. The hotter the oil is, the easier it is for it to travel through ports and valves. To prevent this typical fade-in control, Ohlins has implemented a temperature-controlled needle bleed valve system that will expand as temperatures rise, slowly increasing restriction in the fluids flow through the valve gap. This produces a consistent dampening rate that maintains the vehicle's suspension characteristics lap after lap, turn after turn, no matter how hard you push your suspension's capabilities.

With the KW DDC button, the respective driving mode, Comfort, Sport, or Sport+ can be selected changing the adaptive KW DDC ECU coilover kit damper setting within milliseconds. In Sport+ mode, the adaptive KW dampers give every car an unadulterated driving behavior. A setup which is ideal for demanding rides on twisty roads with lots of load changes. The Sport mode, however, is perfect for driving on the highway with long curves, while the Comfort mode is the ideal for traveling on poorly developed roads. In Comfort mode, the suspension adjusts automatically to the respective driving situation. You are not buying a mass-produced, generic coilover kit, a KW coilover has been developed specifically for your particular vehicle. As a manufacturer, KW uses only its own resources, high-quality components and the damper technology that has all developed in-house. With the KW DDC coilovers, the rolling motion of the body will be reduced during compression giving you the benefit of more direct handling and confidence while driving.

With the adaptive KW DDC Plug & Play coilover suspensions there are no compromises to be made and you can combine the control of your standard damper system with a seamless suspension lowering and the driving dynamics tuned by KW suspensions experienced engineers. During installation, the factory electronic struts are simply replaced by KW “inox-line” stainless steel coilover struts and the adaptive KW dampers are connected to the on-board electronics using your vehicle's original plugs. Fitting a KW DDC Plug & Play coilover suspension requires no further modifications. The standard dampers can simply be replaced with the KW DDC (Dynamic Damping Control) coilover kit. The existing controls and the button installed in the vehicle interior for the operation of the damper control will now operate the KW DDC Plug & Play coilovers.

Pagani, Ducati and Kawasaki. Over time, thanks to extensive R&D, testing, and tuning, their products have evolved into some of the highest quality suspension systems in the world, providing years of flawless operation on both the street and the track. Ohlins' latest automotive suspension system, the DFV (Dual Flow Valve) Road and Track Coilover Kit, has bridged the gap between comfortable stock suspension and track focused coilover kits. These kits provide a ride that glides over typical bumps and dips in the road, all without the typical hard rattle and harsh feel of usual coilovers, and turn in tight and maintain tire grip and traction in corners significantly better than stock suspension ever could. This is all thanks to the spring rate chosen and Ohlins and their signature Dual Flow Valve. The DFV maintains comfort and agility by giving the same characteristics for both rebound and compression, allowing the wheel and tire to maintain constant contact with the road/track for maximum control. The Dual Flow Valve works by controlling shock fluid flow based on resistance and impact velocity. This is controlled in both compression and rebound, giving the quick shock operation that helps maintain traction. At low shaft travel speeds, oil flows mostly through the shaft jet bleed. At higher shaft speeds, oil flows mostly through the compression/rebound ports in the piston. At very high shaft speeds, or during sudden accelerations from potholes or large bumps in the road, oil can then escape through the ports in the DFV, absorbing a large amount of energy that would otherwise throw off the balance and control of the vehicle and keeping the tire planted firmly on the ground. With all three compression and rebound ports working together according to pressure and shaft speed, the result is the notorious premium suspension feel that only Ohlins can offer. In addition to managing the rebound and compression control, coilovers must also properly address heat changes in the shock oil. As the shock is pushed harder and longer, the oil quickly heats up due to friction and compression, and the oils flow characteristics change. The hotter the oil is, the easier it is for it to travel through ports and valves. To prevent this typical fade in control, Ohlins has implemented a temperature controlled needle bleed valve system that will expand as temperatures rise, slowly increasing restriction in the fluids flow through the valve gap. This produces a consistent dampening rate that maintains the vehicle's suspension characteristics lap after lap, turn after turn, no matter how hard you push your suspension's capabilities.

Combining years of race-winning design and engineering with real-world testing, KW has introduced a line of coilovers that checks all the boxes and then some. If you are looking for maximum adjustability, reliability, and comfort then this is the kit for you. Lowering of 15-40mm Front and 15-40mm Rear. Two-Step Rebound Valve with Adjustable KW TVR-A Rebound Stage Damping Technology The rebound stage damping is precisely tuned to the respective vehicle on our in-house drive dynamics test facility, with the setting fixed in the mid-range. Individual customization can be achieved in 16 precise click positions, allowing you to choose between more comfort or more body control. The two-step patented TVR-A technology allows the damper oil to flow through an adjustable, conical low-speed valve during slow piston speeds, while during higher piston speeds the main rebound stage valve opens to handle the flow of large volumes of oil. This provides a major improvement in ride comfort without influencing the high-speed in the safety-relevant zone. Two-Step Compression Stage Valve with Low and High-Speed KW TVCLH-A Adjustment Technology This is the high-end motorsports technology for the most demanding street and track performance customers. Two separate valves and a two-way adjustable compression stage valve allow separate compression damping changes in the low and high-speed range. The adjustments are made via two adjustment dials with click increments that feature 16 settings (with 15 clicks) in the high-speed valve housing and 7 settings (with 6 clicks) in the low-speed housing. During tuning at the KW drive dynamics test facility, the groundbreaking V4 coilover suspension is tuned to a mid-level basic setting for the best road performance with an additional recommended setting for occasional track day use. The 3A Clubsport coilover suspension is tuned to a mid-level factory setting especially for track day use, with an additional recommended setting for the drive to the race track. Starting from the factory setting, the damping can be set firmer or softer for low and high-speed. External Reservoir The use of KW reservoirs provides additional volume for additional oil and additional cooling capacity for extremely high-performance setups. The reservoir is filled with low gas pressure and can be fitted anywhere and accommodates the adjustable compression stage valve to provide the damper with more working space.

Before KW DDC Plug & Play coilovers were introduced to the market, you often had to make compromises when customizing your suspension lowering, and often had to eliminate the active electronic control system and comfort features that you had paid extra for. With the adaptive KW DDC Plug & Play coilover suspensions there are no compromises to be made and you can combine the control of your standard damper system with a seamless suspension lowering and the driving dynamics tuned by KW suspensions experienced engineers. During installation, the factory electronic struts are simply replaced by KW “inox-line” stainless steel coilover struts and the adaptive KW dampers are connected to the on-board electronics using your vehicle's original plugs. Fitting a KW DDC Plug & Play coilover suspension requires no further modifications. The standard dampers can simply be replaced with the KW DDC (Dynamic Damping Control) coilover kit. The existing controls and the button installed in the vehicle interior for the operation of the damper control will now operate the KW DDC Plug & Play coilovers. For the first time, the KW DDC Plug & Play coilover kit combines the advantages of a KW coilover suspension with the convenience of the standard electronic damper controls. At the push of a button, the driver can choose between the Comfort, Normal and Sport setup optimized for the KW coilover suspension. In addition, the KW coilover suspension allows individual ride height adjustability within the tested adjustment range. Our original equipment quality suspension technology is compatible with various vehicle manufacturers. As a result, the adaptive KW DDC suspension is instantly recognized by the on-board electronics. So all the displays and controls of your factory vehicle remain fully functional but you get a completely new driving experience.

From the factory, the XTA plus 3 coilover kit is equipped with KW dampers that are adjustable in high- and low-speed compression as well as adjustable rebound damping. With 24 clicks of adjustment for each, high speed and low speed compression damping and 18 clicks of rebound adjustment, your suspension knows no limits. It doesn't matter if you bolt in an aftermarket roll cage, weld in a cage, modification to PU bushings, upgrade to spherical bushing, or changed wheel loads - the XTA plus 3 coilover has what it takes to keep your car dialed! Of course, the XTA plus 3 also includes a parts approval certificate, race springs, and aluminum uniball bal top mounts. Easy lowering adjustment Like all ST coilovers the lowering adjustment is made via a continuous thread on the galvanized strut. This even allows the lowering to be made even when the kit is installed by turning the spring plate higher or lower! NOTE: The lowering of each vehicle differs greatly with ST XTA plus 3 coilovers due to the type of construction. KW Engineering: Exclusive for ST suspension The high-quality ST XTA plus 3 coilover is based on the twin-tube damping principle of low friction combined with pressure-resistant damper housings. Manufactured directly at KW, a mono block guide and seal package reduces the friction of the damper as well as protecting it against corrosion and dirt. Each galvanized strut is sealed multiple times to ensure maximum longevity in ALL weather conditions. Latest damping technology for maximum longevity Reduced system friction for effective damping adjustment Individual lowering within the tested adjustment range Front and rear axle (when possible) with thread adjustment Galvanized coilover struts with additional coating for an optimized corrosion protection Complete solution with adjustable spring plate, race spring system and bumpers with dust protection Aluminium adjustable uniball top mounts (when possible) Scaled camber adjustment (optionally also caster), when possible 3-way adjustable dampers: 18 clicks low-speed rebound damping 24 clicks low-speed compression damping 24 clicks high-speed compression damping",,,,,,

If you are looking for maximum adjustability, reliability, and comfort then this is the kit for you. Lowering of 15-40mm Front and 15-40mm Rear. Two-Step Rebound Valve with Adjustable KW TVR-A Rebound Stage Damping Technology The rebound stage damping is precisely tuned to the respective vehicle on our in-house drive dynamics test facility, with the setting fixed in the mid-range. Individual customization can be achieved in 16 precise click positions, allowing you to choose between more comfort or more body control. The two-step patented TVR-A technology allows the damper oil to flow through an adjustable, conical low-speed valve during slow piston speeds, while during higher piston speeds the main rebound stage valve opens to handle the flow of large volumes of oil. This provides a major improvement in ride comfort without influencing the high-speed in the safety-relevant zone. Two-Step Compression Stage Valve with Low and High-Speed KW TVCLH-A Adjustment Technology This is the high-end motorsports technology for the most demanding street and track performance customers. Two separate valves and a two-way adjustable compression stage valve allow separate compression damping changes in the low and high-speed range. The adjustments are made via two adjustment dials with click increments that feature 16 settings (with 15 clicks) in the high-speed valve housing and 7 settings (with 6 clicks) in the low-speed housing. During tuning at the KW drive dynamics test facility, the groundbreaking V4 coilover suspension is tuned to a mid-level basic setting for the best road performance with an additional recommended setting for occasional track day use. The 3A Clubsport coilover suspension is tuned to a mid-level factory setting especially for track day use, with an additional recommended setting for the drive to the race track. Starting from the factory setting, the damping can be set firmer or softer for low and high-speed. External Reservoir The use of KW reservoirs provides additional volume for additional oil and additional cooling capacity for extremely high-performance setups. The reservoir is filled with low gas pressure and can be fitted anywhere and accommodates the adjustable compression stage valve to provide the damper with more working space.

Bilstein backs up their technology with a limited lifetime warranty. TUV approved for fitment, safety, and quality! dampers in the PSS9 offer 9 precise settings for compression and rebound.

Now for the biggest improvement, the PSS-9's. The car centers and tracks MUCH better, is more connected and above 20mph is ""smoother"". Inshort it is a diff. car. How is it possible for the coil-overs to have that much of an affect, and I have yet to track it. Was there something wrong with the stock equipment? Do you align to diff. specs that work better? Or is the stock suspension just not good?

These are among the easiest coil over kits on the market - no special mounts required (works with stock mounts and sway bar links), larger adjustment knob allows for easy shock damping changes, and coil over spanner wrenches included for easy height changes. Bilstein backs up their technology with a limited lifetime warranty. TUV approved for fitment, safety, and quality! dampers in the PSS10 offer 10 precise settings for compression and rebound. A new setting is just a click away, allowing you to set a ride and handling combination that works for your setting. Instead of offering too many shock settings that you're never going to use, Bilstein has chosen ten optimal damping curves from a smooth street setting (P10) to an ultra-stiff track-only setup (P1). Shock changes are made from an easy-to-use over-sized adjuster knob. are done from perches that ride on each shock body, which are zinc coated for excellent wear and corrosion resistance. You can set the ride height between 0.5 to 1.3 inches lower than stock ride height. Springs are progressively rated so their initial compression rating is quite soft and then becomes stiffer as the spring compresses. These are stiffer than most coil over kit manufacturers and the results of Bilstein's extensive testing on the German Nurgburgring and Autobahn. is just like a standard shock and spring package. The front struts and rear shocks are compatible with the stock strut and shock mounts. You can re-use your own or choose a mount with additional features. Because the Bilstein design keeps the sway bar tab in the original location, you can re-use the stock sway bar links. Using the stock mounts keeps the cost and complexity down and allows for TUV certification. You can also be assured of the stock mount's quiet and long-lasting performance. The assembly of the front strut is the same as a the factory strut. In the rear, ride height is made by an adjustable spring perch that sits under the rear spring.

The Ridecontrol is a performance coil over system combined with EDC technology for cars that were not available with EDC from the factory. Now you can choose your suspension stiffness on the fly along with the benefits of a Bilstein PSS coil over!   An EDC (Electronic Damping Control) system uses an electronic control module wired to each shock absorber to vary the stiffness of the shock. With the Bilstein B16 kit you can choose between a primary Comfort setting or a stiffer Sport setting via a dash mounted button. You can leave it in Comfort for around-town running and instantly get a tighter and more responsive suspension for twisty country roads. The Comfort setting is also dynamic - sensing road characteristics and g-forces to instantaneously firm the suspension when you're pushing the car, just like a factory installed EDC system.   The basic kit is a Bilstein PSS system with true coil over front struts, rear shocks, four springs, height adjusters, and the EDC module, wiring, and button. The front struts are zinc coated for superior corrosion resistance. The system installs just like a normal suspension and uses the factory original front upper strut mounts. The rear requires the purchase of new shock mounts because of the larger shock shaft. You can choose to mount the EDC control module anywhere in the car (we chose the trunk floor) and then plug the harness into each shock and mount your button in the dash. Ride height can be set from 1.0""-1.75"" lower than stock. Installation instructions included but professional installation is strongly recommended.

Coil overs are also more useful when larger wheels/tires are used because you can precisely set the ride heights to clear the new tires.

KW has set the shock damping rates to be an excellent balance for a smooth yet taut ride, and to resist bodyroll motions for better handling. The Variant 1 differs from the Street Comfort set in that it has stiffer springs and revised shock settings. If you want a sportier ride and better handling than stock the Variant 1 is an excellent choice. Coil over suspensions are better engineered suspension options compared to a standard shock + spring package. Since the springs and shocks in a coil over are designed by a team of engineers to work together, there is much better suspension travel and more precisely tuned specifications for spring and shock rates. Using separate shock and spring specs may result in premature coil bind or shock bottoming. And most coil over kits offer more features than the traditional packages. Coil overs are also more useful when larger wheels/tires are used because you can precisely set the ride heights to clear the new tires.

The KW DDC ECU Coilover suspension features three vehicle-specific damper setups. At the touch of a button, you can choose between the basic Sport setting, a very sporty and performance-oriented Sport+ setup or Comfort mode. With the KW DDC button, the respective driving mode, Comfort, Sport, or Sport+ can be selected changing the adaptive KW DDC ECU coilover kit damper setting within milliseconds. In Sport+ mode, the adaptive KW dampers give every car an unadulterated driving behavior. A setup which is ideal for demanding rides on twisty roads with lots of load changes. The Sport mode, however, is perfect for driving on the highway with long curves, while the Comfort mode is the ideal for traveling on poorly developed roads. In Comfort mode, the suspension adjusts automatically to the respective driving situation. You are not buying a mass-produced, generic coilover kit, a KW coilover has been developed specifically for your particular vehicle. As a manufacturer, KW uses only its own resources, high-quality components and the damper technology that has all developed in-house. With the KW DDC coilovers, the rolling motion of the body will be reduced during compression giving you the benefit of more direct handling and confidence while driving.

KW has set the shock damping rates to be an excellent balance for a smooth yet taut ride, and to resist bodyroll motions for better handling. The Variant 1 differs from the Street Comfort set in that it has stiffer springs and revised shock settings. If you want a sportier ride and better handling than stock the Variant 1 is an excellent choice. Coil over suspensions are better engineered suspension options compared to a standard shock + spring package. Since the springs and shocks in a coil over are designed by a team of engineers to work together, there is much better suspension travel and more precisely tuned specifications for spring and shock rates. Using separate shock and spring specs may result in premature coil bind or shock bottoming. And most coil over kits offer more features than the traditional packages. Coil overs are also more useful when larger wheels/tires are used because you can precisely set the ride heights to clear the new tires. Fitment Note: Wheel spacers may be required depending on wheel/tire sizing and ride height setting. Lifetime warranty!",,,,,,"For Wagon, 2WD Models"

This gives you the opportunity to upgrade your vehicle with an adaptive damper systen and electronically control the level of performance or comfort that meets your requirements Included in the package is a KW “inox-line” coilover suspension with high-quality stainless steel struts, electronically adjustable dampers, a high-performance control unit with a vehicle-specific set of cables, a KW DDC control button giving you control from the comfort of the drivers seat, and elaborate assembly instructions for an easy installation. The KW DDC ECU Coilover suspension features three vehicle-specific damper setups. At the touch of a button, you can choose between the basic Sport setting, a very sporty and performance-oriented Sport+ setup or Comfort mode. With the KW DDC button, the respective driving mode, Comfort, Sport, or Sport+ can be selected changing the adaptive KW DDC ECU coilover kit damper setting within milliseconds. In Sport+ mode, the adaptive KW dampers give every car an unadulterated driving behavior. A setup which is ideal for demanding rides on twisty roads with lots of load changes. The Sport mode, however, is perfect for driving on the highway with long curves, while the Comfort mode is the ideal for traveling on poorly developed roads. In Comfort mode, the suspension adjusts automatically to the respective driving situation. You are not buying a mass-produced, generic coilover kit, a KW coilover has been developed specifically for your particular vehicle. As a manufacturer, KW uses only its own resources, high-quality components and the damper technology that has all developed in-house.
