BMW's N54 had a notoriously rocky start with reliability due to multiple issues such as fuel injectors failing, turbos failing, serpentine belt failure, crank hubs coming loose, and more... BMW made multiple attempts to fix the issues plaguing the N54, but they could only do so much and the fixes rolled out seemed temporary at best. Following the N54, BMW released their updated N55 and S55 engines, giving many people hope that these engines would address the previous issues. Unfortunately, this was only some-what the case. Crank hubs and crank bolts continued to loosen over time and serpentine belts continued to shred themselves and get pulled into the oil pan through the front main seal. For all three engines, this meant a single failure could effectively turn your engine into an oversized paperweight. Luckily for us, the BMW community is full of skilled enthusiasts who have gladly taken up the task to offer solutions! The first headache to be addressed was the Crank Hub and Bolt. Using a simple plate that fits perfectly over your crank hub's hex-head bolt and mounts up against the damper, the crank bolt is effectively locked in place, preventing it from being able to back out until the plate is fully removed. Next up was the serpentine belt failures. It's not known what exactly causes the serpentine belt to split, but once it does, the pieces hanging off of the belt wrap around and behind the damper. This leads to the belt breaking up into smaller pieces and eventually getting pushed between the crank hub and rear main seal into the oil pan. These small pieces of debris get caught in and block the oil pickup, preventing oil flow and leading to engine failure. To prevent this, multiple aftermarket companies came up with their own versions of Crank Seal Plates. This plate is installed behind the front damper, blocking the opening that allows the serpentine belt to pass between the crank hub and seal, keeping debris out of your oil pan! Also included in this kit are the components to service your front Oil Cooler/Filter Housing gaskets, refresh your drive belt system, and install the aftermarket upgrades.

BMW's N54 had a notoriously rocky start with reliability due to multiple issues such as fuel injectors failing, turbos failing, serpentine belt failure, crank hubs coming loose, and more... BMW made multiple attempts to fix the issues plaguing the N54, but they could only do so much and the fixes rolled out seemed temporary at best. Following the N54, BMW released their updated N55 and S55 engines, giving many people hope that these engines would address the previous issues. Unfortunately, this was only some-what the case. Crank hubs and crank bolts continued to loosen over time and serpentine belts continued to shred themselves and get pulled into the oil pan through the front main seal. For all three engines, this meant a single failure could effectively turn your engine into an oversized paperweight. Luckily for us, the BMW community is full of skilled enthusiasts who have gladly taken up the task to offer solutions! The first headache to be addressed was the Crank Hub and Bolt. Using a simple plate that fits perfectly over your crank hub's hex-head bolt and mounts up against the damper, the crank bolt is effectively locked in place, preventing it from being able to back out until the plate is fully removed. Next up was the serpentine belt failures. It's not known what exactly causes the serpentine belt to split, but once it does, the pieces hanging off of the belt wrap around and behind the damper. This leads to the belt breaking up into smaller pieces and eventually getting pushed between the crank hub and rear main seal into the oil pan. These small pieces of debris get caught in and block the oil pickup, preventing oil flow and leading to engine failure. To prevent this, multiple aftermarket companies came up with their own versions of Crank Seal Plates. This plate is installed behind the front damper, blocking the opening that allows the serpentine belt to pass between the crank hub and seal, keeping debris out of your oil pan! Also included in this kit are the components to service your front Oil Cooler/Filter Housing gaskets, refresh your drive belt system, and install the aftermarket upgrades.

BMW's N54 had a notoriously rocky start with reliability due to multiple issues such as fuel injectors failing, turbos failing, serpentine belt failure, crank hubs coming loose, and more... BMW made multiple attempts to fix the issues plaguing the N54, but they could only do so much and the fixes rolled out seemed temporary at best. Following the N54, BMW released their updated N55 and S55 engines, giving many people hope that these engines would address the previous issues. Unfortunately, this was only some-what the case. Crank hubs and crank bolts continued to loosen over time and serpentine belts continued to shred themselves and get pulled into the oil pan through the front main seal. For all three engines, this meant a single failure could effectively turn your engine into an oversized paperweight. Luckily for us, the BMW community is full of skilled enthusiasts who have gladly taken up the task to offer solutions! The first headache to be addressed was the Crank Hub and Bolt. Using a simple plate that fits perfectly over your crank hub's hex-head bolt and mounts up against the damper, the crank bolt is effectively locked in place, preventing it from being able to back out until the plate is fully removed. Next up was the serpentine belt failures. It's not known what exactly causes the serpentine belt to split, but once it does, the pieces hanging off of the belt wrap around and behind the damper. This leads to the belt breaking up into smaller pieces and eventually getting pushed between the crank hub and rear main seal into the oil pan. These small pieces of debris get caught in and block the oil pickup, preventing oil flow and leading to engine failure. To prevent this, multiple aftermarket companies came up with their own versions of Crank Seal Plates. This plate is installed behind the front damper, blocking the opening that allows the serpentine belt to pass between the crank hub and seal, keeping debris out of your oil pan! Also included in this kit are the components to service your front Oil Cooler/Filter Housing gaskets, refresh your drive belt system, and install the aftermarket upgrades.

BMW's N54 had a notoriously rocky start with reliability due to multiple issues such as fuel injectors failing, turbos failing, serpentine belt failure, crank hubs coming loose, and more... BMW made multiple attempts to fix the issues plaguing the N54, but they could only do so much and the fixes rolled out seemed temporary at best. Following the N54, BMW released their updated N55 and S55 engines, giving many people hope that these engines would address the previous issues. Unfortunately, this was only some-what the case. Crank hubs and crank bolts continued to loosen over time and serpentine belts continued to shred themselves and get pulled into the oil pan through the front main seal. For all three engines, this meant a single failure could effectively turn your engine into an oversized paperweight. Luckily for us, the BMW community is full of skilled enthusiasts who have gladly taken up the task to offer solutions! The first headache to be addressed was the Crank Hub and Bolt. Using a simple plate that fits perfectly over your crank hub's hex-head bolt and mounts up against the damper, the crank bolt is effectively locked in place, preventing it from being able to back out until the plate is fully removed. Next up was the serpentine belt failures. It's not known what exactly causes the serpentine belt to split, but once it does, the pieces hanging off of the belt wrap around and behind the damper. This leads to the belt breaking up into smaller pieces and eventually getting pushed between the crank hub and rear main seal into the oil pan. These small pieces of debris get caught in and block the oil pickup, preventing oil flow and leading to engine failure. To prevent this, multiple aftermarket companies came up with their own versions of Crank Seal Plates. This plate is installed behind the front damper, blocking the opening that allows the serpentine belt to pass between the crank hub and seal, keeping debris out of your oil pan! Also included in this kit are the components to service your front Oil Cooler/Filter Housing gaskets, refresh your drive belt system, and install the aftermarket upgrades.
