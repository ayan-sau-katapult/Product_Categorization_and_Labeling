Cost, material construction, intended use, and reliability are just a few things to think about. Some people desire lips with hand-laid carbon fiber no matter the cost, others just want whatever is cheapest and fits. Unfortunately, the market has become flooded with numerous examples of both extremes, with few options offering true ""best of both worlds"" quality. This is where our Turner Motorsport LTW Inspired ABS Front Lip comes in! At the start of this project, we wanted a lip that looks great and offers real downforce benefits, but also doesn't empty our wallets. Designed in-house using 3D scan modeling and CAD, our front lip is a cost-effective, yet highly appealing option with a lot to offer! Made specifically for the M3 front bumper, this ABS front lip is durable, lightweight, and easy to install. This LTW Inspired Front Lip is a perfect alternative to expensive carbon fiber front lips that are prone to failure, and a more rugged option than typical cheaper plastic lips which provide few benefits and offer questionable fitment at best. Utilizing UV stabilized ABS in a two-piece bonded design, this lip has shown to provide the best possible combination of cost-to-performance and retains the clean matte finish of the original E36 trim. If matte black isn't your thing, this lip can easily be prepped and painted to whatever color you desire. Features & Specifications: LTW inspired design Vacuum formed ABS plastic with UV resistant construction 2-Piece bonded design for increased rigidity Designed by TMS engineers using 3D laser scanning & CAD for precision fitment Uses factory self-tapping screws for installation (Need new hardware? See T#599749) Includes pre-applied 3M double-sided adhesive for additional retention and a tight seal against the front bumper"

Using UV stabilized ABS in a two-piece bonded design has shown to provide the best possible combination of cost-to-performance and retains the clean matte finish of the original E36 trim. Front splitters are an important aerodynamic upgrade that not only changes the look of your car, but also helps to create downforce, improving your vehicles overall handling at higher speeds. Unfortunately, due to their low-slung positioning, they are often susceptible to damage from road debris, uneven roads and driveways, speed bumps, and more. This can often make it hard to justify spending copious amounts on money on a part who's days are numbered, especially when being installed on a vehicle that sees both track and daily driver use."

The spoiler matches the curve of the E92 trunklid which gives it a very purposeful and deliberate appearance. Its shape and dimensions have been optimized to reduce aerodynamic lift without being a gung-ho add-on piece. Due to the differences in trunklid shapes, this will not fit E93 convertibles.

The largest of these is the carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (GFP) roof panel, which weighs over 13 pounds less than its conventional steel counterpart. Many enthusiasts sought after the BMW OEM roof to add to their vehicles, but the part was and is to this day only available to those with a CSL vin #. As an answer to the E46 M3 clients, RKP is proud to introduce the RKP E46 M3 carbon fiber roof panel. Their carbon roofs are constructed by hand at a local facility specializing in components for Grand Am, Time Attack, and various hill climb and formula car classes.

Using single piece construction, the carbon is laid inside of a mold instead of being wrapped around it. This allows for a much stronger piece in the end and allows much greater control when the resin is applied. Areas such as door hinges, hood latches and window regulator mounting points are reinforced so as to add strength and longevity through repeated use. Application of the resin is then accomplished using proprietary techniques that allow for a much more uniform coating than most competitors and yields a product that is lighter, since there is no excess. Finally the product is finished with a glossy clear coat this resists chipping and cracking and gives a glossy wet look. Inspection of the finished product is then performed to ensure there is no weave distortion in tight corners or complex bends."

The process begins with the best carbon raw material manufactured in either USA or France; in fact it is the same stock that can be found on high performance racecars, battleships and satellites. Supporting race teams is one of Seibons' specialties and you will see their work in many different platforms and racing types. Drivers such as Michele Abbate in her Scion FRS racecar, Fredric Aasbo in his Formula D Scion tC and even team RS-R in Asian Formula D all rely solely on Seibon to get them to the podium. Using single piece construction, the carbon is laid inside of a mold instead of being wrapped around it. This allows for a much stronger piece in the end and allows much greater control when the resin is applied. Areas such as door hinges, hood latches and window regulator mounting points are reinforced so as to add strength and longevity through repeated use. Application of the resin is then accomplished using proprietary techniques that allow for a much more uniform coating than most competitors and yields a product that is lighter, since there is no excess. Finally the product is finished with a glossy clear coat this resists chipping and cracking and gives a glossy wet look. Inspection of the finished product is then performed to ensure there is no weave distortion in tight corners or complex bends. Features: Proprietary methods to lay wet carbon for a stronger and lighter product UV resistant resins, even a weathered part can be wet sanded and brought back to original finish Panels are 70% lighter than stock as opposed to competitors which come in around 50% lighter than stock. No black paint is used to hide imperfections along detail edges and creases. Partnered with SCCA and Formula Drift bringing their top quality fit and finish to the competition environment.

There are countless aero products that have initial “shock and awe” value, but lose their panache as they age. With RKP, their design philosophy has been rooted in creating a lasting effect, a truly timeless design that can be enjoyed and admired for years to come. As physical testaments of their design success, RKP's E9X M3 and F10 M5 programs continue to be highly sought after—with their F8X M3 / M4 and F87 M2 components following suit. A tall bar they’ve set then for the almighty F90 M5. Not to fall victim to the dreaded sophomore slump, they knew this F10 successor would have to bring something special to the table. From the moment the entire F90 was 3D scanned, several meetings were held to help infuse the new M5’s unique design aesthetics into their suite of aerodynamic offerings. It’s almost befitting to have the trunk spoiler come at the tail end of their F90 program, a proverbial “cherry on top” of a comprehensive lineup. As a prominent design feature with RKP's M2 trunk spoiler, the roofline channel was carried into the new M5’s piece as well. This helps create some much-welcomed continuity to the rear of the car and gives a subtle nod to a similar treatment they integrated into their front lip design. As you’d expect from RKP, the F90 spoiler is sculpted to cover the full width of the trunk and offers a dynamic, upright curve to help promote extra downforce in addition to a stunning look. To help bring further attention to the piece, the RKP F90 M5 trunk spoiler is finished in hand lain 2x2 carbon twill and treated to a beautiful gloss.

BMW had of course already used advanced composites in the construction of their M cars for many years, but the use of a bare carbon fiber roof made a unique statement that set the M brand apart forever. Over the years RKP has helped E90 M3 and 1M car owners make the same statement by developing our own carbon fiber roof panels for the cars not given this privilege from the factory. RKP introduces the brand new carbon fiber roof panel for the F10 M5. This roof panel is available in a variety of weave styles to match OE carbon fiber or to deviate from the factory look instead. The RKP roof panel weighs in at a featherweight 11.5lbs, removing a tremendous amount of weight from the most critical area of the car.

As the M3 GT4 still used the same stock front bumper cover as your typical M3 street car, this splitter can be added to ANY 2008 or newer BMW M3.    Made of 100% carbon fiber, this front splitter includes fully functional brake duct openings for maximum cooling.

It will lower the height of the bodywork and will contribute to the car’s racing character. It will compose very well with side skirts, as well as, a front splitter. Such a composition will be inventive and noticeable to all automotive enthusiasts. The valance can be purchased in three types of surface structure: textured, gloss, and carbon. The ABS utilized in the manufacturing of the BMW M5 E39 rear valance is flexible, durable, and insusceptible to mechanical and chemical damage. It does not succumb to the negative influence of moisture and does not wear off easily from extreme temperatures. ABS works extraordinarily well, in the production of tuning parts, and primary vehicle equipment components alike. The rear valance proposed by Maxton Design has been granted the TUV MATERIALGUTACHTEN certificate. This product is a replacement for the original BMW M5 E39 valance."
