As we have seen over time the plastic can crack which leads to oil leaks, excessive oil blow-by, vacuum leaks, poor running, and other issues. Unfortunately, it's not just the gasket that needs periodic replacement but the entire valve cover itself. This kit includes a new valve cover, gaskets, and hardware. The valve cover also incorporates the oil separator and check valves which are not a replaceable item on its own. So a complete valve cover replacement will tackle multiple problem areas at once.     The plastic used for the N54 valve cover is thin and weak in certain spots. This makes it prone to hairline or larger cracks that will leak oil and cause vacuum leaks. You might also notice rough running especially at idle and fault codes for fuel trim. Often a technician will go looking for a failed ignition coil, spark plug, or failed vacuum hose on the engine. But without a fault code to assist in diagnosis this can often mean wasted time and money. A cracked valve cover is a new problem area that many techs don't think to check. And the problems are more prevalent on modifed engines running more boost.     BMW integrated the oil separator system into the valve cover on these later engines. An internal manifold creates a cyclone effect and centrifugal force separates vapor from the liquid oil. The liquid oil is supposed to drain through the valve cover and back to the oil pan while the remaining vapor is burned up during combustion. It's a very efficient and environmentally-friendly design with very few moving parts. Unfortuntely it's not perfect and eventually the internal passageways will become clogged. This problem is made worse in cars that have short drive cycles, sit for long periods of time, do not have frequent oil changes, do not see regular runs to redline, and cars in freezing climates. If the engine never reaches optimal operating temp the oil remains in liquid form or becomes sludge. This is bad news for the entire engine, leading to excessive oil blow-by, fouled spark plugs, rough running and misfires and even premature failure of catalytic converters and oxygen sensors. Since the oil separator system in the valve cover is not available on its own, and cleaning it is nearly impossible, the complete replacement of the valve cover is the only option. Other oil vent tubes and vacuum hoses are also recommended to get replaced at the same time.     As with any rubber part, failures occur when the rubber becomes dry and brittle. The pliable rubber no longer forms a seal between the cylinder head and valve cover where it will develop an oil leak. Valve cover gaskets that leak can allow oil to seep into the spark plug holes and contaminate ignition coil boots and plugs. That can lead to rough running and misfires. A new valve cover includes new gaskets.   All new hardware is included to avoid re-using and over-tightening the original bolts (they have a very low torque rating).   Replacement requires accessing the rear of the engine with a lot of the upper plastic shrouding removed. The metal fuel line must also be removed and disconnected from the fuel injectors. Professional installation is encouraged if you have never done this kind of work before. Serious DIY types should have a Bentley Service Manual to use which greatly explains the process. You may also want to combine this work with the oil filter housing gasket replacement.   There is no maintenance or replacement interval for the N54 valve cover. However, we have seen cracks and other failures in the 50,000-90,000 mile range. Our best advice is to plan on a major top end overhaul around the 70-80,000 mile mark. There's no mechanical downside to replacing it as prevention and it will make the engine run better and last longer.     2008-2010    135i  2011    1M Coupe  2007-2010    335i 335xi 335i xDrive - Sedan  2007-2010    335i 335is 335xi 335i xDrive - Coupe  2007-2010    335i - Convertible  2007-2010    535i 535xi 535i xDrive  2008-2010    X6 xDrive35i  2009-2010    Z4 sDrive35i Z4 sDrive35is"

Oil leaks - and the damage they can cause - seem to be the worst annoyances on these cars. The biggest source of an oil leak is from the valve cover, followed by the oil filter housing, Valvetronic seal, camshaft seals, and the eccentric shaft sensor seal. Once the oil leaks, and if ignored for an extended time, the oil will contaminate vital electrical sensors. This is especially the case with ignition coils and also the eccentric shaft sensor on the Valvetronic shaft at the top of the cylinder head. During any ignition coil and spark plug replacement take a close look inside for any oil pooling at the bottom. We have been seeing valve cover oil leaks as soon as 40,000 miles. We look for oil leaks on every E90 that comes into our shop.We have put together this package of valve cover gaskets and other related gaskets and seals for you to fully overhaul the N52 valve cover and put a stop to those pesky oil leaks.

As we have seen over time the plastic can crack which leads to oil leaks, vacuum leaks, poor running, and other issues. Unfortunately, it's not just the gasket that needs periodic replacement but the entire valve cover itself. This kit includes a new valve cover, gaskets, eccentric shaft seal, and hardware. The valve cover also incorporates the oil separator which is not a replaceable item on its own. So a complete valve cover replacement will tackle multiple problem areas at once. The valve cover is the same for N51 SULEV and N52 engines. Cracked Valve Cover. The plastic used for the N52 valve cover is thin and weak in certain spots. This makes it prone to hairline or larger cracks that will leak oil and cause vacuum leaks. You might also notice rough running, especially at idle. Often a technician will go looking for a failed ignition coil, spark plug, or failed vacuum hose on the engine. And without a fault code to assist in diagnosis this can often mean wasted time and money. A cracked valve cover is a new problem area that many techs don't think to check. Oil Separator/Crankcase Vent. BMW integrated the oil separator system into the valve cover on these later engines. An internal manifold creates a cyclone effect and centrifugal force separates vapor from the liquid oil. The liquid oil is supposed to drain through the valve cover and back to the oil pan while the remaining vapor is burned up during combustion. It's a very efficient and environmentally-friendly design with very few moving parts. Unfortunately it's not perfect and eventually the internal passageways will become clogged. This problem is made worse in cars that have short drive cycles, sit for long periods of time, do not have frequent oil changes, do not see regular runs to redline, and cars in freezing climates. If the engine never reaches optimal operating temp the oil remains in liquid form or becomes sludge. This is bad news for the entire engine, leading to fouled spark plugs, rough running and misfires and even premature failure of catalytic converters and oxygen sensors. Since the oil separator system in the valve cover is not available on its own, and cleaning it is nearly impossible, the complete replacement of the valve cover is the only option. Other oil vent tubes and vacuum hoses are also recommended to get replaced at the same time. Valve Cover Gaskets. As with any rubber part, failures occur when the rubber becomes dry and brittle. The pliable rubber no longer forms a seal between the cylinder head and valve cover where it will develop an oil leak. Valve cover gaskets that leak can allow oil to seep into the spark plug holes and contaminate ignition coil boots and plugs. That can lead to rough running and misfires. A new valve cover includes new gaskets. Eccentric Shaft Seal. The seal for the eccentric shaft sensor is a known spot for oil leaks. When the seal to the valve cover fails oil can end up in the sensor itself and ruin the sensor (an unecessary $300 expense). Usually a new seal (o-ring) will stop the leaks but sometimes the valve cover is at fault too. A new eccentric shaft seal is included. All new hardware is included to avoid re-using and over-tightening the original bolts (they have a very low torque rating). Replacement requires accessing the rear of the engine with a lot of the upper plastic shrouding removed. The vent hose on the valve cover should be replaced as it is almost always broken anyway (#11157559528). The metal fuel line must also be removed and disconnected from the fuel injectors. Professional installation is encouraged if you have never done this kind of work before. Serious DIY types should have a Bentley Service Manual to use which greatly explains the process. You may also want to combine this work with the oil filter housing gasket replacement. There is no maintenance or replacement interval for the N52 valve cover. However, we have seen cracks and other failures in the 50,000-90,000 mile range. Our best advice is to plan on a major top end overhaul around the 70-80,000 mile mark. There's no mechanical downside to replacing it as prevention and it will make the engine run better and last longer.

Oil leaks - and the damage they can cause - seem to be the worst annoyances on these cars. The biggest source of an oil leak is from the valve cover, followed by the oil filter housing, Valvetronic seal, camshaft seals, and the eccentric shaft sensor seal. Once the oil leaks, and if ignored for an extended time, the oil will contaminate vital electrical sensors. This is especially the case with ignition coils and also the eccentric shaft sensor on the Valvetronic shaft at the top of the cylinder head. During any ignition coil and spark plug replacement take a close look inside for any oil pooling at the bottom. We have been seeing valve cover oil leaks as soon as 40,000 miles. We look for oil leaks on every E90 that comes into our shop.   We have put together this package of valve cover gaskets and other related gaskets and seals for you to fully overhaul the N52 valve cover and put a stop to those pesky oil leaks. This package has the replacement parts for N52 engines built from the 2007 model year and includes:     2007 and later N51/N52 engines do not need replacement valve cover bolts, unless the bolts are actually broken off or missing. Unlike the 2006 aluminum hardware, the later parts are steel and not 1-time use.   These are all OEM or OE parts. Replacement of these gaskets and seals is straight-forward but a long process. BMW dealers typically charge for over eight hours of labor. If you have replaced spark plugs before you should be capable of this repair. In addition, there are several other parts to replace while you're in the vicinity: camshaft sensor o-rings, oil filter housing profile gasket, VAN0S solenoids, and the eccentric shaft sensor. These other parts, except the eccentric shaft sensor (see below), are replaceable without removing the valve cover but are more easily accessed during the valve cover work.   Eccentric Shaft Sensor: This is the position sensor that relays the eccentric shaft's position back to the DME. It's located at the front of the engine and   . The seal around the sensor can fail and allow oil to blow out from under the cam cover. Oil can then leak into the sensor itself and cause it to fail. Without a functioning sensor your E90 can experience poor running, hesitation, poor performance, jerky shifts, and sluggish response. It's easy to check and see if oil has accumulated inside the sensor: unbolt the engine trim cover (the outer cover with the BMW roundel), unplug the sensor, and look inside. If oil is present inside or even around the sensor itself, plan on replacing this sensor during your next ignition coil, spark plug, and/or valve cover gasket work.     2008-2012    128i  2007-2011    328i 328xi 328i xDrive - Sedan  2007-2012    328i 328xi 328i xDrive - Wagon  2007-2013    328i 328xi 328i xDrive - Coupe  2007-2013    328i - Convertible  2007-2010    528i 528xi 528i xDrive  2011    528i  2007-2010    X3 3.0i X3 3.0si  2007-2013    X5 3.0si  10/2006-2008    Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si  2009+    Z4 sDrive30i"

As we have seen over time the plastic can crack which leads to oil leaks, excessive oil blow-by, vacuum leaks, poor running, and other issues. Unfortunately, it's not just the gasket that needs periodic replacement but the entire valve cover itself. This kit includes a new valve cover, gaskets and hardware. The valve cover also incorporates the oil separator and check valves which are not a replaceable item on its own. So a complete valve cover replacement will tackle multiple problem areas at once. Cracked Valve Cover. The plastic used for the N54 valve cover is thin and weak in certain spots. This makes it prone to hairline or larger cracks that will leak oil and cause vacuum leaks. You might also notice rough running especially at idle and fault codes for fuel trim. Often a technician will go looking for a failed ignition coil, spark plug, or failed vacuum hose on the engine. But without a fault code to assist in diagnosis this can often mean wasted time and money. A cracked valve cover is a new problem area that many techs don't think to check. And the problems are more prevalent on modifed engines running more boost. Oil Separator/Crankcase Vent. BMW integrated the oil separator system into the valve cover on these later engines. An internal manifold creates a cyclone effect and centrifugal force separates vapor from the liquid oil. The liquid oil is supposed to drain through the valve cover and back to the oil pan while the remaining vapor is burned up during combustion. It's a very efficient and environmentally-friendly design with very few moving parts. Unfortuntely it's not perfect and eventually the internal passageways will become clogged. This problem is made worse in cars that have short drive cycles, sit for long periods of time, do not have frequent oil changes, do not see regular runs to redline, and cars in freezing climates. If the engine never reaches optimal operating temp the oil remains in liquid form or becomes sludge. This is bad news for the entire engine, leading to excessive oil blow-by, fouled spark plugs, rough running and misfires and even premature failure of catalytic converters and oxygen sensors. Since the oil separator system in the valve cover is not available on its own, and cleaning it is nearly impossible, the complete replacement of the valve cover is the only option. Other oil vent tubes and vacuum hoses are also recommended to get replaced at the same time. Valve Cover Gaskets. As with any rubber part, failures occur when the rubber becomes dry and brittle. The pliable rubber no longer forms a seal between the cylinder head and valve cover where it will develop an oil leak. Valve cover gaskets that leak can allow oil to seep into the spark plug holes and contaminate ignition coil boots and plugs. That can lead to rough running and misfires. A new valve cover includes new gaskets. All new hardware is included to avoid re-using and over-tightening the original bolts (they have a very low torque rating). Replacement requires accessing the rear of the engine with a lot of the upper plastic shrouding removed. The metal fuel line must also be removed and disconnected from the fuel injectors. Professional installation is encouraged if you have never done this kind of work before. Serious DIY types should have a Bentley Service Manual to use which greatly explains the process. You may also want to combine this work with the oil filter housing gasket replacement. There is no maintenance or replacement interval for the N54 valve cover. However, we have seen cracks and other failures in the 50,000-90,000 mile range. Our best advice is to plan on a major top end overhaul around the 70-80,000 mile mark. There's no mechanical downside to replacing it as prevention and it will make the engine run better and last longer.

This gasket is used to seal the gap between the valve cover and the cylinder head, however, since this gasket is made of rubber it has a tendency to become brittle, crack, and start to leak due to its constant exposure to heat and engine oil."
