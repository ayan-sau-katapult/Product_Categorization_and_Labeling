If you have noticed that your heat or A/C is not blowing as strong as normal, this could be due to a clogged filter. Swap out your dirty, old filter to ensure your air is clean and easy-flowing! Filters that incorporate activated charcoal offer further protection than standard dust and pollen filters. The layers of activated charcoal within the filter are able to absorb unpleasant odors and reduce allergens levels significantly over stock-style standard filters. Cabin filters should be changed out every 30,000 miles to maintain optimal comfort. If you have noticed reduced airflow through your HVAC system before this point, the filter is most likely clogged and should be replaced early to prevent air pollutants from circulating through the vehicle's cabin."

Does it only run at one speed or not work at all? Then a likely culprit is this blower resistor, often called the ""final stage unit"" in the BMW world. The function of this part is to regulate the voltage of the blower motor on BMWs which use the digital climate control. This blower resistor is a notorious weakness on the cars that use it. When it fails, your blower fan speed can fluctuate as if it has a mind of its own, or get stuck at one position. BMW has updated this item several times and we only carry the most current version.

Does it only run at one speed or not work at all? Then a likely culprit is this blower resistor, often called the ""final stage unit"" in the BMW world. The function of this part is to regulate the voltage of the blower motor on BMWs which use the digital climate control. This blower resistor is a notorious weakness on the cars that use it. When it fails, your blower fan speed can fluctuate as if it has a mind of its own, or get stuck at one position. BMW has updated this item several times and we only carry the most current version from OEM provider Hella, ensuring you get the highest quality parts possible."
