It's a multi-function tool that you will never get tired of picking up and checking out.     Since it plugs into the car's OBD communication port it has unparalleled access to a stream of engine data. It reads and displays throttle position, boost, ignition advance, wastegate duty cycle, mass air flow, intake air temperature, air/fuel ratio, calculated load, and much more. You can also record data for later analysis - up to 10 hours of running data! It also works as a timing meter for 0-60, 1/8 mile, 60' acceleration, 330' acceleration, and 1,000' acceleration time. You can plug the AccessPort into a PC or Mac and view all of this saved data in their program. This information is invaluable for evaluating engine performance and performance modifications.     With access to the OBD port, the Cobb tuner can also read and reset Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). This saves you a trip to the dealer or local shop simply to have a fault code interpreted. Now you can pull these codes and get an answer to the problem right away! The code number and a brief description of the code is given so you won't even have to search for it online. Reset the code and you're on your way (unless the code comes back...).     The AccessPort comes pre-loaded with 4 tuning files - Stage 0 (stock), Stage 1 Sport (91 octane), Stage 1 Aggressive (93 octane), and a Valet file. Additional files are available from the Cobb website for things such as an intake and larger intercooler. It can hold up to 100 different tuning files! It also saves your stock original file so you can revert back to stock at any time. The AccessPort maintains the sophisticated control logic, refined engine response and excellent driveability of the stock BMW computer while providing impressive power gains and improved performance.

It simply plugs in to the OBD communication port - no modifications or re-wiring needed at all! Pop out your stock air vent, run the data cables through the dash, reinstall the vent with the new display and you're done! The P3 gauge reads and interprets data available from the OBD port and displays it in realtime. Data that was previously only available with advanced factory diagnostic tools is now literally at your fingertips. On newer models BMW took away gauges and information displays and now you can get that information back! Use the data stream to evaluate your engine performance, acceleration and braking improvements from modifications, cooling system performance, battery condition, and more. Use the data to spot signs of trouble before it's too late. You can record and play back 15 seconds of data for analysis. It also works as a diagnostic trouble code display and has a clear function for resetting the codes. Auxiliary inputs also included so you can read actual boost on supercharged or turbo engines (t-connector and vacuum line included). This makes it the perfect companion to JB or other piggyback modules so you can display the actual boost instead of reading the incorrect value from the OBD port.The whole kit is installed in the original left-side air vent housing. You can order it two ways - the basic display for a DIY install in your original vent (easy!) or pre-installed in a new OE BMW vent (easier!). Wit the cables and hardware tucked away behind the dash there is no trace of the P3 gauge's aftermarket installation. It's so well-integrated that it looks like a factory BMW part! It's color-matched to your existing gauges and has a dimmer feature. The entire kit is totally reversible. The P3 uses the car's existing OBD communication port, which is the same one used by dealerships, shops, and state inspection stations so just unplug the connector when access to the OBD port is required.  The P3 gauge is equipped with three analog inputs which allows you to add other sensors and more data. For instance, if you wanted to display Air/Fuel readings you can use an analog line to your AFR wideband sensor in the exhaust. Or fluid temps from the transmission, differential, etc. You can also read before/after intercooler temps or just about anything else you can imagine. The P3 gauge becomes your own custom dash just like a race car. Additional parts and gauge configuration will be required when using any analog inputs. The P3 wiring works with any analog 0-5V sensor which is the standard among universal sensors.  - if you're not in love with the P3 gauge like we are, send it back for a full refund (less shipping costs)  - covers you from defects for one year"
