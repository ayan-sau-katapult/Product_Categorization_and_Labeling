We know that controlling the harmonic resonance of the BMW 6 is highly important as RPMs rise, but the ideal configuration of the inline-6 motor makes even experienced engine builders overlook some fundamental principals of engine harmonics that can be destructive. ATI Performance Products has partnered with VAC Motorsports to develop new dampers for BMW 2.5L, 2.8L, 3.0L and 3.2L straight-6 engines found in the E36 and E46 M3, E9X and E6X, as well as newer Z3s and Z4s. These dampers eliminate crankshaft harmonic vibration, which allows the engine to produce more horsepower and torque, while also reducing internal engine wear at the same time. Broken oil pumps and timing chains will be a thing of the past! When used with a VAC accessory pulley, these dampers are a direct replacement over the OEM balancer. They have a 7” outer diameter and include OEM style timing alignment tabs. BMW enthusiasts should know that all ATI Super Dampers exceed SFI 18.1 Safety Certification and are approved for competition. The advantages of the ATI SuperDamper include eliminating vibration issues with inline 6 engines equipped with lightweight clutch and flywheel assemblies, reduced bearing, engine accessories, oil pump wear, and compatibility with underdrive pulleys.

We offer our kits in two different ways: the full Power Pulley Kit with all 3 pulleys or a 2 pulley kit if you do not wish to underdrive your alternator (for large stereo systems or other battery-draining modifications). Our kits have been tested for compatability with the factory premium stereo systems (Harmon Kardon, etc). But any major alterations or upgrades from the factory system will work best with our 2 pulley kit and no underdriving of the alternator. For all stock stereo systems the 3 pulley set is recommended because the Turner alternator pulley will help make more power and is also much lighter than the stock pulley.              2001-2002    Z3 3.0i",https://1c2a8a2161d644d95009-22d26b38e78c173d82b3a9a01c774ffa.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/pages/tms_ppk_detail.pdf
