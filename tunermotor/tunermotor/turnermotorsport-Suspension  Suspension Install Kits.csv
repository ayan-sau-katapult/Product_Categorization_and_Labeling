Don't forget the bushings! The rubber mounts for the shocks will go bad over time, especially if you drive hard or the roads are particularly rough. The shock mounts locate the front struts and rear shocks to the car - providing a quiet and vibration-free buffer between the road and the cabin. Shock mounts and bushings can wear out just like any other rubber part on the car. This leads to more noise and harshness reaching the chassis and may complicate your new suspension install. When installing new shocks, that is the perfect time to also replace the mounts. There is no additional time to install them, no special tools required, and doesn't take any extra time! If you re-use the original mounts you have the risk of them failing before your next shock replacement, doubling your labor costs."

https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-340199-3-series-rear-suspension-mount-package-rubber-street-bushings-e46-m3/,3-series Rear Suspension Mount Package - Rubber Street Bushings - E4...,340199,TMS2276,$638.81,"This package allows you to build your own rear bushing package to cover the parts you want to replace. As these cars age, they require a number of suspension bushings to be replaced. Bushing replacement not only keeps the car in its top form, it also makes the car safer. Depending on the work, it may be logical to replace all of the bushings in the rear suspension (there are 19 total). This is especially true if you are pulling the subframe out to do the floor reinforcement or if you're doing a diff install. Turner Motorsport is a big believer in using rubber bushings for street cars (with the exception of solid subframe mounts, see further below). Urethanes, Delrin, or aluminum are generally good for reducing compliance and limiting deflection - attributes that don't really work well on roads filled with potholes, railroad crossings, cracks, and expansion joints. The rubber bushings maintain the factory ride/handling traits that won the M3 praise all over the world. Every bushing will need maintenance or replacement at some point and rubber has proven to last the longest and need less maintenance than anything else, even urethane. And unless competitive driving is your goal, the harder materials are only a gimmick."
