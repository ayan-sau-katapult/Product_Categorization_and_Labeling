Owners of the E39 M5 and E46 M3 will know that the stock pads are already quite 'aggressive' from the factory with a lot of initial bite. The initial bite was built into the pad to stop criticism of BMW's lack of 'performance' brakes. Instead of building the M models with exotic - and expensive - multi-piston calipers, BMW engineers turned up the braking power in their pads. For the street, these are excellent brake pads with excellent feel and performance. The only downside is the dust that comes from an organic pad. The problem with many aftermarket and OEM pads is that they do not match the same level of initial bite as the stock OE BMW pads. This can make the brakes feel 'weak' and 'numb' even though the pads are working properly. If you want to maintain your braking feel, these are the best to use.   Although these pads were originally designed for M cars, they fit other models as well, making them a great first-step upgrade for better braking.   Price is for one set of pads - enough to replace the pads on both rear calipers.     1999-2006    330i 330ci 330xi M3  1997-2003    M5  2004-2010    525i -2/07  2004-2010    530i 530xi 528i 528xi 528i xDrive 535i 535xi 535i xDrive  1995-2001    740i 740il 750il  1990-1999    840i 840ci 850i 850ci 850csi  2004-2010    X3 2.5i X3 3.0i X3 3.0si  2000-2006    X5 3.0i X5 4.4i X5 4.6is X5 4.8is  2003-2008    Z4 M Roadster M Coupe  2000-2003    Z8 Roadster"

The beauty of these pads is that you can put them on at home or your shop and use them to drive to and from the track, with a full day of on-track driving in between. While these track pads actually do work on the street, noticeable increases in noise, dust, and brake wear are to be expected. These pads are great for the weekend track junkie who wants exceptional street performance while also having a capable pad on the track. They are excellent for novice and first-time drivers while also being a favorite of instructors too. And they are inexpensive compared to most full race pads.   These are not all-out racing pads, however, and they work best when used within their temperature range (100-800*F). Higher friction levels and brake temps will increase wear, especially on heavier cars. Brake cooling kits are strongly recommended.

If you started out with HP Plus but feel like you are ready to advance to a more aggressive pad these are an excellent choice. The DTC-30 pads have greater torque output than an HP Plus and a very consistent torque curve which makes them more capable during hard track use than an HP Plus. These are intended for advanced users but should not be considered all-out race pads (unless used to balance brake bias).   The Hawk DTC (Dynamic Torque Control) compound offers the highest friction coefficients of any Hawk pad. The DTC pads offer high torque with aggressive and controllable initial bite, superior modulation and release characteristics, and excellent torque control. DTC-30 compound is often used as a replacement to Hawk Blue when more torque is wanted."

The initial bite was built into the pad to stop criticism of BMW's lack of 'performance' brakes. Instead of building the M models with exotic - and expensive - multi-piston calipers, BMW engineers turned up the braking power in their pads. These pads go a step further as the pads that originally came on the Euro E46 M3 and all E46 M3 ZCPs. For the street, these are excellent brake pads with excellent feel and performance. The only downside is the dust that comes from an organic pad. The problem with many aftermarket and OEM pads is that they do not match the same level of initial bite as the stock OE BMW pads. This can make the brakes feel 'weak' and 'numb' even though the pads are working properly. If you want to maintain your braking feel, these are the best to use.Although these pads were originally designed for M cars, they fit other models as well, making them a great first-step upgrade for better braking.Price is for one set of pads - enough to replace the pads on both front calipers."

The beauty of these pads is that you can put them on at home or your shop and use them to drive to and from the track, with a full day of on-track driving in between. While these track pads actually do work on the street, noticeable increases in noise, dust, and brake wear are to be expected. These pads are great for the weekend track junkie who wants exceptional street performance while also having a capable pad on the track. They are excellent for novice and first-time drivers while also being a favorite of instructors too. And they are inexpensive compared to most full race pads.   These are not all-out racing pads, however, and they work best when used within their temperature range (100-800*F). Higher friction levels and brake temps will increase wear, especially on heavier cars. Brake cooling kits are strongly recommended. If you find these pads are not lasting, or you are exceeding their performance capability, it will be time to step into a full, dedicated track/racing pad.     1984-1991    318i 318is 318ic 325e 325es 325i 325ic 325is 325ix"

If you started out with HP Plus but feel like you are ready to advance to a more aggressive pad these are an excellent choice. The DTC-30 pads have greater torque output than an HP Plus and a very consistent torque curve which makes them more capable during hard track use than an HP Plus. These are intended for advanced users but should not be considered all-out race pads (unless used to balance brake bias).   The Hawk DTC (Dynamic Torque Control) compound offers the highest friction coefficients of any Hawk pad. The DTC pads offer high torque with aggressive and controllable initial bite, superior modulation and release characteristics, and excellent torque control.

This compound combines the outstanding wear rate of the RSL19 with a slightly higher coefficient of friction and initial bite. RSL29 also features improved hot fade resistance over the RSL19. In addition to the endurance racing, this pad will also be found in GT and VLN classes and Touring Cars (including our own E46 World Challenge cars). BMW has been using Pagid Yellow pads on their Nurburgring test vehicles and Ring Taxi for years.

The requirements for those applications make these an ideal pad for BMW enthusiasts too! Although pricier than regular street pads the Pagid Sport pads return phenomenal performance and rave reviews. These pads are intended for heavy and aggressive street braking or mild open track lapping. We consider these to be 'dual purpose pads' that can be driven every day but also used occasionally on the track*. Even though street use is acceptable these pads work best when they have a little bit of heat in them.  * - These can be used as a track pad, however, care must be taken not to overheat them for prolonged periods.

BMW used several different suppliers for their brake pads and we buy direct from their distributors to get you the same pad as originally equipped but at a fraction of the cost of the local BMW dealer. OEM brands include Pagid, Textar, Jurid, Ate, and others. These are the same pads as what originally came on your car but without the expensive BMW logo."

The Street 5.0 pads are perfect for drivers who don’t want an ordinary replacement pad and want something that will hold up during aggressive street driving. The Street 5.0 pads are similar to the established Hawk HPS pads but with more initial bite. While the HPS pads fill the need of a direct replacement OEM-type pad, the Street 5.0 kicks braking performance into the next gear. With the Street 5.0 pads you can expect: Better stopping power even when the pads are cold Good initial bite (more than on Hawk HPS) Excellent resistance to fade during street use Moderate dust during normal street driving Quiet operation Easy on rotors"

The requirements for those applications make these an ideal pad for BMW enthusiasts too! Although pricier than regular street pads the Pagid Sport pads return phenomenal performance and rave reviews. These pads are intended for heavy and aggressive street braking or mild open track lapping. We consider these to be 'dual purpose pads' that can be driven every day but also used occassionlly on the track*. Even though street use is acceptable these pads work best when they have a little bit of heat in them.  * - These can be used as a track pad, however, care must be taken not to overheat them for prolonged periods.
