This fuel injector is most commonly used on Ford Mustangs, and other domestic V8's, which require a healthy amount of fuel. This is a genuine Bosch fuel injector and sold individually, so be sure to order enough for your application.    We use this particular Bosch injector on modified E36 M3 BMWs, which require more fuel to balance the air/fuel ratio after adding modifications such as cold air intake, cams, headers, etc. During our own testing we found the stock BMW injectors reach their limits with only a few modifications (intake, HFM, and basic chip). Anything more than these basic upgrades and you will need larger injectors. In the packages and kits we have developed we found the 24# pound fuel injector to be ideal � not too large and not too small. With the correct software you can run your engine without fear of the mixture being too lean. This is the fuel injector we use in our 3.2 OBD-II kits as well as in our 3.0/3.2 OBD-I systems. This injector, and the software we have developed when using them, are designed for the E36 M3 BMWs only (We have not seen a reason to use them on a E36 325 or 328).   The original �24lb injector� that was common for E36 M3s since 1995 has been harder and harder to find. While once common in the BMW and other tuning markets, they are no longer produced new by Bosch in the original spec. In order to maintain the balance in our tuning programs we have sourced refurbished 24lb blue top injectors that have been cleaned and flow-tested to be of the correct spec and matching to the software in our packages. There are other injectors out there but vary slightly in spec and we wanted to remain as true to the original tuning work that we did.    Note: you should never use a fuel injector that is not properly calibrated to your engine with the proper software! Doing so can seriously damage the engine, ECU, or injectors.      1995-1998    M3 - Manual Transmission Only  1998-2000    M Roadster M Coupe"

BMW called them ""lifetime"" but there's no question that any filter is going to get saturated with debris and dirt and its performance will suffer. The dirty filter can cause E90/E92 running issues like stalling, poor performance, rough running, chugging. We have replaced these filters in cars with 130,000+ miles and found the original filter was long overdue for replacement. These cars had the above driveability problems but had no fault codes or DTCs (which led to other shops making poor service recommendations). So we recommend having this done at the 80-100,000 mile mark as a scheduled maintenance item. There's no harm or downside to replacing it before it's completely clogged and your engine starts to suffer.   The fuel filter is located on the driver's side and includes two new large o-rings for the lock rings. The crossover lines to the fuel pump on the passenger side are included as well. We recommend new steel lock rings for the filter and the pump, especially on cars located in the Rust Belt or in salty climates. On really high mileage cars it would be a good idea to also replace the fuel pump as preventative maintenance since the job is essentially the same. The E9X fuel filter replacement is not complex but access can be difficult and you're dealing with potentially fragile plastic so amateurs may want to leave this to a professional technician.   When doing any sort of repair or maintenance there is no replacement for genuine factory parts.

Bucketless pumps should not be driven on tanks lower than 1/4 full and should not be used for road course racing.

Their team of young and intelligent engineers pair their passion for the industry with a rich education background, which results in a high-quality enthusiast-minded products. Spool Performance's state-of-the-art upgrades for your BMW fueling systems are a surefire way to make more power, reliably. The Helix from Spool is simply a planetary gearbox for your High-pressure fuel pump. The particular configuration of the gears and their spatial fixturing allows an axial increase in shaft speed from the input to the output of the unit. The N54/early n55 high-pressure pump is a very capable and over-engineered piece of hardware. They do a good job supplying fuel at high pressures at stock power levels. As we start tuning and pushing more power, we start seeing drops in the high pressure. What is happening here is that the high-pressure pump is not able pump as much fuel as the injectors are injecting into the cylinders and hence causing the rail pressures to drop. The pump at this point is running out of displacement volume. With a rotary pump like the continental HPFP, an easier way to increase displacement is to spin the pump faster which results in an increased number of delivery strokes per cycle. The Helix helps you do exactly this and thus helps overcome a big limitation in N54/early N55 fuel systems without the complexity of a secondary port injection system."

This is caused by a less efficient siphon pick up tube in the driver's side sending unit. During hard cornering this will cause the car to temporarily run out of fuel which can cause engine damage or cause the car to become unsettled at an inopportune time. With the later fuel pump sending units you can start having fuel starvation as early as 3/8 of a tank of gas where with the earlier sending units this condition does not start to occur until below 1/4 tank. This kit is a great inexpensive way to get more fuel out of your tank. For endurance racing there are other more expensive ways to get all the fuel out of your tank, but for driver schools or sprint races this is the way to go. In the four years that Turner Motorsport ran the E36 in SCCA Touring car this is the fuel pump setup that was used and there was never any fuel starvation problem after this conversion.   **This kit is for 01/1995 and later E36 6 cylinder. We recommend checking your production date / fuel pump to be sure you don't already have this fuel pump in your car. If you have the later (01/1995 and newer) style pump, then you will want (need!) this kit.

Both low and high-pressure fuel pumps can only flow so much fuel, limiting power potential regardless of turbo size or other power adders, especially when running an ethanol blend. Upgrade your BMW fuel pump with Precision Raceworks' Low-Pressure Bucketed Fuel Pump Kits. Precision's low-pressure fuel pumps are designed to flow significantly more fuel than your BMW's stock system, ideal for customers who are upgrading their vehicles or plan to run blended fuel or E85 alone! This is a true plug-and-play solution that anyone can install in their home garage and start taking advantage of the benefits right away. Precision Raceworks' Stage 2+ bucketed fuel pump kit includes a genuine Walbro 535 (F90000295) fuel pump, capable of supporting up to 650whp on 93 octane pump gas or 550whp on 100% E85! In order to prevent having to send in your fuel pump, each of Precision Raceworks' kits includes thorough instructions and all of the items required to assemble your kit at home. This prevents delays in shipping, potential damage to your stock fuel pump housing, and reduces assembly costs to keep prices low. It also improves installation as there is no guesswork on engagement and sealing of o-ring or complications and risks of tightening clamps that can poke holes in critical plastic components nearby. While all bucketless fuel pumps flow .2gpm more than a bucket design that retains the venturi, it comes at a cost. Bucketless pumps should not be driven on tanks lower than 1/4 full and should not be used for road course racing. This is not a disadvantage of only bucketless designs, but also a disadvantage for any bucket design which deletes the venturi. If you do not plan on road course or drag racing (not street racing) and are responsible at maintaining 1/4 tank of fuel during spirited driving, bucketless pumps can be a cheaper alternative for you."

This sensor can be traced to a number of drivability issues, including cold start running problems, misfires, stumbling, hesitations, and overall rough running. You will likely have a code for the misfires, rich condition, or for the sensor itself. In some cases, the combination of codes can bring about a limp mode.

Both low and high-pressure fuel pumps can only flow so much fuel, limiting power potential regardless of turbo size or other power adders, especially when running an ethanol blend. Upgrade your BMW fuel pump with Black Market Parts (by Precision Raceworks) Low-Pressure Bucketless Fuel Pump. Precision's low-pressure fuel pumps are designed to flow significantly more fuel than your BMW's stock system, ideal for customers who are upgrading their vehicles or plan to run blended fuel or E85 alone! This is a true plug-and-play solution that anyone can install in their home garage and start taking advantage of the benefits right away. The Black Market Parts Stage 2+ bucketless fuel pump kit includes a genuine Walbro 535 (F90000295) fuel pump, capable of supporting up to 650whp on 93 octane pump gas or 575whp on 100% E85, and is the perfect modular pump to get you started! Always looking ahead, Precision Raceworks designed their modular bucketless fuel pump kit to allow you to upgrade your fuel pump as needed! With an open expansion slot, a simple Stage 3 or Stage 3.5 pump module is all you need to purchase to increase your fueling capabilities up to 1100whp*. While all bucketless fuel pumps flow .2gpm more than a bucket design that retains the venturi, it comes at a cost. Bucketless pumps should not be driven on tanks lower than 1/4 full and should not be used for road course or drag racing. This is not a disadvantage of only bucketless designs, but also a disadvantage for any bucket design which deletes the venturi. If you do not plan on road course racing (not street racing) and are responsible at maintaining 1/4 tank of fuel during spirited driving, bucketless pumps can be a cheaper alternative for you."
