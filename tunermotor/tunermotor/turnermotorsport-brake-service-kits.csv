The 315mm rotors are 31mm (1.22"") bigger than a standard E28 rotor and still 15mm (.59"") larger than a stock M5 rotor. The larger rotors will contribute to shorter stopping distances and the extra mass is better at managing heat, especially under track and fast road conditions. And E34 M5 rotors feature a vented hub for even better brake cooling. The E34 M5 brakes are a straight bolt-on to the stock E28 spindle. Your original brake lines and pad wear sensor fits with the new brakes. Some 16"" wheels may fit over the M5 brakes but 17"" wheels are better. The only other recommended item is the E32 brake master cylinder which will push more fluid through the system and avoid longer pedal travel. This has long been an underground secret upgrade among E28 enthusiasts but only recently have calipers and caliper brackets been available at very reasonable prices. You no longer have to pick them off a junk car!   Brake Rotor Size Comparison:      The original E28 M5 caliper is a 4-piston design that is becoming harder to source as a fully rebuilt unit. A new caliper from BMW will sell for around $600! Caliper seals are still available to rebuild a useable original caliper. But if the pistons or caliper housing are scored or rusted beyond saving then a full replacement is your only option. And that's what makes this kit such a great upgrade and replacement alternative. It uses OEM parts that are a direct fit to the car and replacement parts are very easy to source down the road. This has long been a common upgrade for E28 owners so this makes a great overhaul kit for cars that have already had the conversion done.   The E34 caliper has a lot more options for pads than any stock E28 caliper. The pad shape is the same as an E36 M3 so there are dozens of options for street, mixed use, and all-out track pads. We've made a few options available in the menu below or you can browse all of our E36 M3 pad options by     Kit Upgrade Contents:  34112226385, 315mm x 28mm E34 M5 rotors - choose from plain blank style, cross drilled, or slotted  34211161806, rotor retaining screws (x 2)  34112226873W, E34 M5 left front caliper with bracket  34112226874W, E34 M5 right front caliper with bracket  34111151604, caliper mounting bolts (x 4)   Notes:  - 16"" or larger wheels are required to clear these brakes. Some 16"" wheels will not clear depending on their barrel design. Spoke design on any wheel may require the use of a wheel spacer for clearance.  - These are rebuilt calipers so a core charge will apply to each. The core charge is a mandatory selection in the menu below. This charge will be refunded in full when you send back your original calipers with brackets (in the boxes we provide).  - Rebuilt calipers are not coated or painted and they will go through several stages of surface rust. If your calipers will be visible through your wheel, we strongly recommend painting or coating the calipers prior to installation.  - Larger rear rotors from the E34 are also recommended with this kit to avoid too much front brake bias. Using only the front E34 M5 brakes will shift bias towards the front which could lead to easier front wheel lockup during threshold braking. Using the larger E34 rear brakes will restore the brake balance to near stock levels.     1982-1988    528e 533i 535i 535is M5  1982-1989    633csi 635csi M6",Starting at,https://1c2a8a2161d644d95009-22d26b38e78c173d82b3a9a01c774ffa.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/image/brakes/rotors_E28_rotor_upgrade_size_comparisons_E28_E32_E34_E34_M5.jpg,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/BMW-E36-M3/c-317-bmw-brake-pads

If your car has single-piston calipers in front and rear then you have the P337A brakes. If you have Brembo calipers in front and rear then you have the S2NHA upgrade package. The P337A M Sport trim package got you a larger front rotor than the standard 328i/428i brakes (330mm vs 312mm) but used the original caliper in a new mounting position.

We're able to shop from different vendors which gets you a better price while still maintaining original quality.     In some cases, we offer performance alternatives to the OEM items.

This package comes with ECS V4 Slotted rotors and Hawk HPS 5.0 brake pads for excellent stopping power and brake fade resistance. ECS Tuning's V4 Slotted rotors are high-quality rotors that feature an electrostatic rust-inhibiting coating and a fully machined finish. Every one of their rotors are individually inspected for balance and mill-corrected for the best vibration free high-speed operation possible. Hawk HPS 5.0 brake pads are a high-performance street pad with much-improved braking performance and without the levels of dust from a factory pad. The 5.0 pads are perfect for drivers who don’t want an ordinary replacement pad and want something that will hold up during aggressive street driving. The HPS 5.0 pads are similar to the established Hawk HPS pads but with more initial bite and greater resistance to heat fade. This combination ensures that your street and track car will have the best balance of performance for both daily driving as well as weekends on the track without having to completely replace your pads and rotors.,,,

This kit uses the front calipers, caliper brackets, and 302mm rotors from the E32 7-series and E34 540i. This makes the rotors about 3/4"" larger than the stock 528e/535i rotors as well as thicker. The larger rotors will contribute to shorter stopping distances and the extra mass is better at managing heat, especially under track and fast road conditions. But the    about this upgrade is that it's    15"" or larger wheels are the only requirement. There are no other parts required and no modification needs to be done. Your original brake lines and pad wear sensor fits with the new brakes. This has long been an underground secret upgrade among E28 enthusiasts but only recently have calipers and caliper brackets been available at very reasonable prices. You no longer have to pick them off a junk car! And now we can offer more options for pads and rotor styles.   Brake Rotor Size Comparison:      On the M5, the E32/E34 brakes are more of a replacment alternative than a true upgrade. These are the perfect, low cost alternative to the 4-piston M5 caliper. The M5's multi-piston calipers are very hard to find as a fully-rebuilt unit. And new calipers from BMW are over $600 each! Your originals can be rebuilt with new seals but if the pistons or housing is corroded a full replacement is your only option. Changing to a single-piston E34 caliper may sound like a downgrade but they have the same surface area as the four-piston M5. In fact, the master cylinder in the M5 is the same as used on the 535i so the M5 isn't pushing any more fluid. So the brake balance on the M5 stays the same when used with the stock rear rotors. And this is why you don't need a different (750iL) master cylinder either with this kit. With our rebuilt calipers, the brackets are included to make this a direct bolt-on to the E28 steering knuckle.   The E34 caliper also has a lot more options for pads than any stock E28 caliper. The pad shape is the same as an E36 M3 so there are dozens of options for street, mixed use, and all-out track pads. We've made a few options available in the menu below or you can browse all of our E36 M3 pad options by     Kit Upgrade Contents:  34111159896, 302mm x 28mm E32/E34 540i rotors - choose from plain blank style, cross drilled, slotted, or drilled + slotted  34211161806, rotor retaining screws (x 2)  34111160363R, E32/E34 540i left front caliper with bracket (rebuilt)  34111160364R, E32/E34 540i right front caliper with bracket (rebuilt)  34111151604, caliper mounting bolts (x 4)   Notes:  - These are rebuilt calipers so a core charge will apply to each. The core charge is a mandatory selection in the menu below. This charge will be refunded in full when you send back your original calipers with brackets (in the boxes we provide). Or keep your 4-piston calipers for posterity (you would forfeit the core charge).  - Rebuilt calipers are not coated or painted and they will go through several stages of surface rust. If your calipers will be visible through your wheel, we strongly recommend painting or coating the calipers prior to installation.     1982-1988    528e 533i 535i 535is M5  1982-1989    633csi 635csi M6",Starting at,https://1c2a8a2161d644d95009-22d26b38e78c173d82b3a9a01c774ffa.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/image/brakes/rotors_E28_rotor_upgrade_size_comparisons_E28_E32_E34_E34_M5.jpg,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/BMW-E36-M3/c-317-bmw-brake-pads

Our brake package uses the same replacement parts from the same manufacturers as BMW dealers use to service your car. The big difference is that we're able to offer these parts for a substantial savings from the dealer markup price. As an independent company we're able to buy our parts from multiple OEM suppliers whereas BMW dealers must buy their parts from BMW. We're able to shop from different vendors which gets you a better price while still maintaining original quality.     In some cases, we offer performance alternatives to the OEM items. For an enthusiastic BMW owner, the standard BMW part may be inadequate and we offer an upgraded part, based on our almost 20 years of BMW tuning experience. We seek out high quality suppliers and designs that we would want on our own vehicles. Many times performance parts will fix a design flaw with the original BMW part, improving your performance at the same time.        1987-1991    325iX",Starting at,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/t-buying-guide-brake-pads,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/t-buying-guide-brake-rotors

Every one of their rotors are individually inspected for balance and mill-corrected for the best vibration free high-speed operation possible. The front Hawk HPS pads are a high-performance street pad with much-improved braking performance and significantly reduced brake dust. The HPS pads are perfect for drivers who don’t want an ordinary replacement pad and want something that will hold up for aggressive street. The rear Hawk HPS 5.0 brake pads are a high-performance street pad with much-improved braking performance and without the levels of dust from a factory pad. The 5.0 pads are perfect for drivers who don’t want an ordinary replacement pad and want something that will hold up during aggressive street driving. The HPS 5.0 pads are similar to the established Hawk HPS pads but with more initial bite and greater resistance to heat fade. This combination ensures that your street and track car will have the best balance of performance for both daily driving as well as weekends on the track without having to completely replace your pads and rotors.,,,

We're able to shop from different vendors which gets you a better price while still maintaining original quality. In some cases, we offer performance alternatives to the OEM items. For an enthusiastic BMW owner, the standard BMW part may be inadequate and we offer an upgraded part, based on our almost 20 years of BMW tuning experience.

We suggest upgrading your brakes with this TrackSport Brake Kit! Our TrackSport brake kit features our very own full-floating TrackSport rotors, Pagid Racing RSL 29 brake pads, brand new stainless steel set screws, and a genuine BMW pad wear sensor. The combination of these TrackSport rotors and the RSL 29 brake pads make for an amazing combination that allows for extended track sessions, great brake fade resistance, and overall excellent braking characteristics. After feeling the change in braking performance, you'll feel confident pushing your BMW to its limits, chasing down shorter lap times! These TrackSport rotors feature a full-floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force, and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. Designed specifically for high-performance applications, these rotors are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Directional veins further increase this cooling, preventing additional heat soak and keeping your BMW on the track for longer! The RSL29 pad is an endurance racing compound with long life and great wear characteristics. It has stable friction over a broad temperature range which makes them a very easy to use and predictable braking pad in a lot of environments. An evolution of the RSL19 endurance pad designed for more advanced drivers, this compound combines the outstanding wear rate of the RSL19 with a slightly higher coefficient of friction and initial bite. RSL29 also features improved heat fade resistance over the RSL19. In addition to the endurance racing, this pad will also be found in GT and VLN classes and Touring Cars (including our own E46 World Challenge cars). BMW has been using Pagid Yellow pads on their Nurburgring test vehicles and Ring Taxi for years. Included in this kit: Turner Motorsport TrackSport Rotors - 338x26mm Pagid Racing RSL 29 Brake Pads Stainless Steel Set Screws Genuine BMW Brake Pad Wear Sensor",,,

We suggest upgrading your brakes with this TrackSport Brake Kit! Our TrackSport brake kit features our very own semi-floating TrackSport rotors, Pagid Racing RSL 29 brake pads, brand new stainless steel set screws, and a genuine BMW pad wear sensor. The combination of these TrackSport rotors and the RSL 29 brake pads make for an amazing combination that allows for extended track sessions, great brake fade resistance, and overall excellent braking characteristics. After feeling the change in braking performance, you'll feel confident pushing your BMW to its limits, chasing down shorter lap times! These TrackSport rotors feature a semi-floating two-piece design and slotted grooves to allow smooth, consistent braking force, and easy expulsion of gases and dust created by the brake pads and rotors under heavy braking. This means that no matter the conditions, you can expect the braking feel to remain consistent, even throughout long periods of abuse. Designed specifically for high-performance applications, these rotors are significantly more resistant to the effects of heat and friction, lessening the negative effects typically seen with standard rotors. The separation of the friction disk and the rotor hat allows for the rotor ring to expand and helps prevent heat from traveling into other sensitive braking components that could be damaged from prolonged exposure to harsh conditions. Directional veins further increase this cooling, preventing additional heat soak and keeping your BMW on the track for longer! The RSL29 pad is an endurance racing compound with long life and great wear characteristics. It has stable friction over a broad temperature range which makes them a very easy to use and predictable braking pad in a lot of environments. An evolution of the RSL19 endurance pad designed for more advanced drivers, this compound combines the outstanding wear rate of the RSL19 with a slightly higher coefficient of friction and initial bite. RSL29 also features improved heat fade resistance over the RSL19. In addition to the endurance racing, this pad will also be found in GT and VLN classes and Touring Cars (including our own E46 World Challenge cars). BMW has been using Pagid Yellow pads on their Nurburgring test vehicles and Ring Taxi for years.

This combination ensures that your street and track car will have the best balance of performance for both daily driving as well as weekends on the track without having to completely replace your pads and rotors.,,,

Too much front bias will lead to easier front lockup, more wear on the front brakes, and possibly brake fade. Front bias makes the front brakes do more of the work and the rear brakes are not working as much as they could be in slowing the car down. By switching to the larger rear brakes from the E34 540i you can generate more braking force at the rear and create better overall balance. There are several other factors at play too and if you are altering the brakes on your E28 or E24 some experimentation may be required to get the balance where you like it.   This rear brake package includes:  2 x 300x20mm E34 540i/M5 vented rear brake rotors  2 x rotor retaining screws  2 x E34 540i/M5 rebuilt rear brake calipers with brackets  4 x caliper mounting bolts   All of these parts are a direct bolt-on to the E28 rear hub. All of your existing brake lines, pad sensor, and parking brake components work with the E34 parts. You don't even have to modify the brake dust shield.   Notes:  This package is only intended to be used with the E34 M5 front brakes. Using these rear E34 brakes with any other combination of front brakes will result in unknown performance.  These are rebuilt calipers intended for the E34 5-series and a core charge applies. The core charge cannot be refunded if non-E34 calipers are returned. A core exchange only works when the parts are the same. Since E28/E24 calipers will be coming back, they cannot be re-used as E34 cores. Depending on supply, some type of refund may still be available. Even if no core refund is available the cost for rebuilt calipers is still much less than the $400+ for a new BMW caliper with a bracket.     1982-1988    524td 528e 533i 535i 535is M5  1983-1989    633csi 635csi M6",Starting at,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-338643-e34-m5-315mm-front-brake-upgrade-for-e28-528e535im5/,

This package comes with ECS V4 Slotted rotors and Hawk HPS 5.0 brake pads for excellent stopping power and brake fade resistance. ECS Tuning's V4 Slotted rotors are high-quality rotors that feature an electrostatic rust-inhibiting coating and a fully machined finish. Every one of their rotors are individually inspected for balance and mill-corrected for the best vibration free high-speed operation possible. Hawk HPS 5.0 brake pads are a high-performance street pad with much-improved braking performance and without the levels of dust from a factory pad. The 5.0 pads are perfect for drivers who don’t want an ordinary replacement pad and want something that will hold up during aggressive street driving. The HPS 5.0 pads are similar to the established Hawk HPS pads but with more initial bite and greater resistance to heat fade. This combination ensures that your street and track car will have the best balance of performance for both daily driving as well as weekends on the track without having to completely replace your pads and rotors.,,,
