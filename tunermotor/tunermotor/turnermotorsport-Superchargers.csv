This old saying is indicative of the new Generation 8 supercharger system for the E46 M3. Through countless hours of testing, it has often been quoted that the true test has always been a race environment. What better venue than Brock Yates One Lap of America Race. With a rigorous 7,000 miles to be covered within a week, and to compete against the likes of Porsches, Corvettes, Nissan GTRs, this would be the testing grounds for the new Generation Active Autowerke Supercharger system. The Active Autowerke Generation 8 Supercharger System not only proved its worth by being the highest ranked BMW within the field, but also ranked 1st in its class..   The data and technology that made this winning combination is now being applied in the new Generation 8 of the Active Autowerke supercharged E46 M3 level 1. Reliability and power is needed if you want to be on the podium, and this new Generation 8 will deliver exactly that. Consistent, repeatable runs of over 415 WHP (525 engine horsepower) were also recorded on the Active Autowerke chassis dyno in hot 94 + degree Fahrenheit conditions with humidity in the 60% + range. These run conditions might be considered a deterrent and not really suited, but it is better knowing the horsepower numbers are under such conditions, since higher horsepower numbers will only increase as the temperature falls and the air becomes more dense.     Power : 525 BHP @ 7650 rpm  Torque : 335 ft/lbs @ 5400 rpm  Boost Level : 7-8 psi",Installation Instructions included
