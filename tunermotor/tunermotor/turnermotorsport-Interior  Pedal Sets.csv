There's less 'leg lift' to put your foot at the top of the pedal. This eliminates wasted motion and saves time during every shift. An adjustable clutch stop is included to fine tune the travel and release characteristics. This pedal also has an adjustable tension feature. The amount of tension on the spring is adjustable to one of three positions.

Since the clutch arm on most late model BMWs are made from plastic (and have very poor fitting clutch arm bushings), the clutch arm tends to move laterally a bit, allowing the clutch arm to slip a smaller diameter stop. Does not work on E46 or most BMWs after 2000."

Is it also sloppy, and slipping to the side?   Quite simply, it is well-known that BMW's original clutch arm bushings are the culprit for these annoying problems. You can lubricate, replace, curse, even murmur obscure voodoo prayers - but none of that will work.      By simply replacing the stock bushings with the UHMW (Ultra High Molecular Weight polycetal) UUC Motorwerks Clutch Arm Bushings, you can permanently get rid of that annoying squeak and the side-slop.   The great advantage of UHMW over other materials is the superior long-term wear characteristics and self-lubricating properties.    If the clutch pedal arm has become worn, we also recommend replacing the clutch pedal arm.    or       1984-1991    318i 318is 318ic 325e 325es 325i 325ic 325is 325ix M3  1992-1998    318i 318is 318ti 318ic 323is 323ic 325i 325is 325ic 328i 328is 328ic M3  1999-2005    323i 323ci 325i 325ci 325xi 328i 328ci 330i 330ci 330xi M3  1989-1995    525i 530i 535i 540i M5  1997-2003    525i 528i 530i 540i M5  2004-2010    525i 525xi 530i 530xi 528i 528xi 528i xDrive 535i 535xi 535i xDrive 545i 550i M5  1997-2002    Z3 1.9 Z3 2.3 Z3 2.5i Z3 2.8 Z3 3.0i M Roadster M Coupe  2003-2008    Z4 2.5i Z4 3.0i Z4 3.0si Z4 M Roadster M Coupe  and basically all other manual-transmission BMW models built since 1982."
