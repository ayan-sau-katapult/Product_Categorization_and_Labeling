https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-360273-kbs-diamond-finish-restoration-clearcoat/,KBS Diamond Finish Restoration Clearcoat,360273,8X04T,$34.95,Starting at,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-344-chassis-paint-coatings-sealants-and-rust-conversion#,"KBS Diamond Finish is a hardened finishing clearcoat that is applied directly to your prepped or painted surface. It provides an incredibly strong finished layer to protect your painted surface from nicks, dings, chemicals, solvents, brake fluid, and other harsh materials. Diamond Finish is easy to apply; unlike two-part clearcoats it doesn't need a hardener or other additives. Just stir and apply! It can be applied with a conventional spray gun, roller, and brushed on (it's self-leveling and won't leave brush marks behind). You can apply it to cured automotive paints, standard solid color paints, and single or two-part paints, enamels, and lacquered paints. You can even apply it to bare metals - aluminum, alloys, brass, chrome, or copper for a lustrous shine. Although UV-stable, it's not recommended for use on RustSeal where a standard automotive clearcoat will provide better UV protection. Diamond Finish is great as a glossy restoration clearcoat for bare metals like cylinder heads, intake manifolds, brake components, intercoolers, wheels, chrome trim, and more. It will resist yellowing up to temperatures of 325*F."
https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-338446-kbs-motorcycle-fuel-tank-sealer-kit/,KBS Motorcycle Fuel Tank Sealer Kit,338446,520XX,$38.95,Starting at,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-344-chassis-paint-coatings-sealants-and-rust-conversion#,"KBS Fuel Tank Sealer Kit contains all of the essential products to completely clean, treat, and seal a motorcycle fuel tank (5 or 12 gallon sizes). The complete kit is formulated to stop fuel tank rust in its tracks and then coat and seal the tank, including filling small pinholes and weld seams. The final coating is impervious to fuels, alcohol additives, and most solvents. It's a tough ceramic-like barrier against future corrosion.KBS Fuel Tank Sealer Kit includes:+ KBS Klean - for 'washing' and stripping away other chemicals and foreign particles+ KBS Blast - dissolves rust and metal oxides and converts it to a zinc phosphate that is ready for coating+ KBS Gold Standard Tank Sealer - spreadable coating that leaves a rock-hard ceramic-like coating that is very resistant to salt and chemicals+ Chemical-resistant black nitrile gloves+ Brushes and stirring stick+ Detailed instructions The KBS process involves first treating and prepping the rusty area before the final coating is applied. The surfaces must first be cleaned with the KBS Klean to strip away grease and other chemicals that will interfere with coating adhesion. Klean is water based and biodegradable and doesn't have the harsh smells and effects of solvents or chemicals. Let Klean soak but rotate the tank every minutes to ensure complete coverage. The cleaner the tank the better the adhesion so repeat until you're satisfied. The Klean process should be left to completely dry before moving to Step 2. Rust Blast is the actual conversion of rust into zinc phosphate state and is etched for proper paint adhesion. This step is essential for stopping the rust in its tracks and from spreading. It's also a primer for the final stage of coating, leaving behind a white powdery residue. Like the Klean it's also water based and biodegradable. For the rust conversion to be complete pour the Blast into the tank and rotate several times to ensure coverage. Rinse and allow to dry completely before sealing. For the finishing touch, pour the KBS Tank Sealer into the tank. Choose from a Kit for a 5 gallon or 12 gallon tank. It's formulated to be applied as a single coat. Rotate the tank to ensure complete coverage and drain the excess. It's important to not allow the Tank Seal to pool or collect so make sure it drains well. Use any excess to coat and seal the outside of the tank, especially in areas that might have leaks. Tank Seal leaves a very tough and hard surface that is impervious to most solvents, fuels, acids, and road salt. When fully cured it's flexible, allowing it to move as the tank expands and contracts. It's self-leveling too which produces an even finish that will not crack, flake, or peel and will withstand temperatures up 600*F (316*C). The KBS process will need approximately one week to fully complete (the recommended drying time on the tank is four days). This is perfect for restoration jobs or longer builds where the car can sit for an extended period of time."

Fusion is the preferred primer over cured RustSeal coatings in preparation for a color topcoat. Fusion will promote adhesion between multiple surface coatings and even bare metals and most hard plastics. It's part of the ultimate corrosion protector - Blast, Seal, Fusion, and Topcoat. Apply Fusion to a cured RustSeal coating that's been lightly sanded with 280-320 grit sandpaper. Fusion should be used if the RustSeal layer is older than a few days. Apply a thin coat and it will be ready for topcoat in 20-30 minutes. If your RustSeal is not your final top layer the Fusion is the best adhesion primer you'll find."

  ...",350692,TMS209169DK,$22.95,Starting at,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-344-chassis-paint-coatings-sealants-and-rust-conversion#,"KBS Motor Coater is the perfect finishing touch to your engine build. Motor Coater is a high temp resilient acrylic enamel paint designed especially for high temp areas like engine blocks or even brake calipers. Engine paint is a must-do for the perfect finishing touch on an engine build. Most professional engine builders will use it as their signature. A quality engine build is marked by the proper appearance and KBS literally has this covered. Motor Coater is a fast drying and tough acrylic paint. It will not blister, flake, crack, or peel up to temperatures of 450*F. It's special formula resists oils, fluids, gasoline, and other solvents. It's UV resistant and you can use the Diamond Finish clearcoat for added protection. And it comes in a large variety of colors with many OEM and factory shades. For more extreme temperature components like headers and exhausts use the KBS Xtreme coating.   Motor Coater is a lot like the KBS RustSeal chassis paint and the key to a proper and long-lasting finish is with the prep. In order for the paint to properly adhere, it must be cleaned and treated to remove all dirt, solvents, and other contanaments. Using KBS Klean and RustBlast are strongly encouraged to achieve the best adhesion and etching for Motor Coater to work. Application is very easy and can be done via brush or spray gun (diluted). No primer is necessary. Brush strokes will flow out leaving a uniform finish behind. 1-2 coats is all that's needed for full coverage and color depth. Average cure times are 2-4 hours, depending on humidity and temperature, but curing stars rapidly after 30 minutes. A pint will be enough to do most BMW engines. Prep and application are the same for brake calipers. KBS Motor Coater comes in a pint-sized container unless specified differently.   While BMW engine blocks have always been glossy black from the factory, there's nothing stopping you from using another color! A bright engine block is one way to stand apart and impress anyone looking under the hood. And a clean, painted block is a big indicator that your motor is fresh and well taken care of. We want to see your colored engine blocks - send us some KBS BMW engine photos!   Proper prep and cleaning is essential! To get a lifelong finish and protection follow the KBS procedures for cleaning the surface (KBS Klean), treating and etching rust and corrosion (KBS Blast), and then the finished sealcoat (KBS Motor Coater)."

With most two-part epoxies you have to precisely measure out each ingredient to get the correct mix. But NuMetal uses two equal parts, making the mix very easy to work with. It has a very good shelf life so you only use what you need and save the rest for later. It bonds to almost everything, including wet surfaces, and will not shrink or sag. It sets in one hour and fully cured in twelve. After curing, NuMetal can be sanded, drilled, routed, screwed, chiseled, surfaced, tapped, sawed, turned, filed, carved, stained or painted. In addition to a filler it can also serve as a bonding agent for wood, concrete, stone, plastic, tile, and all types of fiberglass and most types of metals. Fabricators and craftsmen will really like this putty because it is easy to use, excellent bonding strength, and low cost.   Available as a 1lb block in grey, black, or tan."
https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-340326-kbs-xtreme-temperature-coating/,KBS Xtreme Temperature Coating,340326,KBS-XTC,$22.95,Starting at,https://www.turnermotorsport.com/c-344-chassis-paint-coatings-sealants-and-rust-conversion#,"KBS Xtreme Temperature Coating (XTC) is for extremely high temp areas like headers, exhausts, or even engine blocks where the Motor Coater is not rated high enough. XTC has a temperature range of 500-1,500*F (1,200* for aerosols) whereas Motor Coater has an upper limit of 450*F. Motor Coater is intended for engine blocks and other external metal surfaces. XTC is what you need on the really hot surfaces like headers and exhaust manifolds. XTC coating acts like a ceramic or header wrap and will retain heat in a header system. This reduces underhood temperatures (less heat soak in the engine bay) and improves exhaust gas velocity (better breathing for the engine). XTC has been especially formulated for high heat applications and will resist heat, weathering, thermal shock, and corrosion. It won't peel, flake, or chalk and lasts a long time. It's actually a very good paint for BBQs and cast iron stoves too.   XTC is very easy to apply with either a brush, paint spray gun, or in a convenient aerosol can. Proper prep with KBS Klean and RustBlast is recommended. A silicone zinc primer is also recommended for maximum corrosion protection. The aerosol or 8oz size is enough to coat most BMW headers with two coats. It's dry to the touch in under an hour and then fully cured at 350*F for 20 minutes. Nine colors are offered from several shades of grey to red, blue, and even white."

It helps prevent corrosion on metals subject to high temps, high humidity, condensation, and salt air. Use it to form another barrier against corrosion on headers and manifolds or engine blocks. It acts just like a galvanizing process. It can even be used on its own as a finishing layer (it is grey in color) or use it with a high temp topcoat such as KBS Motor Coater or KBS Xtreme Temperature Coating paint. It withstands temps in excess of 1,200*F. XTC Primer is available in either a convenient 12oz aerosol spray or in a larger quart size container (dilluting with KBS Thinner is recommended)."

There's the internal and hidden areas that are also susceptible to rust and corrosion. This is where KBS Cavity Coater comes in. The Cavity Coater is a one-step super-penetrating sealant that you spray into frame rails, rocker panels, fenders, hoods, doors, etc. and it will protect from the inside out. It's been tested to give 4,000+ hours of salt spray protection. Initial prep is minimal - remove loose pieces and spray onto dry surfaces or de-grease with KBS Klean or Cavity Coater Remover first. Cavity Coater is thin and will work its way into crevices and joints. For the hardest to reach spots, attach the 18"" wand (sold separately). The 12oz aerosol will cover approximately 90 sq-ft. It's the perfect addition to your E36 or E46 rear subframe repair so you can coat the insides of the rear floor.   We also recommend getting the KBS Cavity Coater Remover for clean-up. Use the Remover on excess Coater and to clean the extension wand. The Remover can also be used to prep the surface to be coated. Remover is sold separately, see below."

The final coating is impervious to fuels, alcohol additives, and most solvents. It's a tough ceramic-like barrier against future corrosion. Gold Standard Tank Sealer can applied as a single coat after cleaning and treating the rust areas with KBS Klean and KBS RustBlast (a sample kit is also available with everything you need). Rotate the tank to ensure complete coverage and drain the excess. It's important to not allow the Tank Seal to pool or collect so make sure it drains well. Use any excess to coat and seal the outside of the tank, especially in areas that might have leaks. Tank Seal leaves a very tough and hard surface that is impervious to most solvents, fuels, acids, and road salt. When fully cured it's flexible, allowing it to move as the tank expands and contracts. It's self-leveling too which produces an even finish that will not crack, flake, or peel and will withstand temperatures up 600*F (316*C).   TankSealer is available in    aimed at different projects:  8oz for 5-gallon tanks (motorcycle)  pint for up to 12-gallon tanks (automotive, light truck)  quart for up to 25-gallons tanks     The KBS process will need approximately one week to fully complete (the recommended drying time on the tank is four days). This is perfect for restoration jobs or longer builds where the car can sit for an extended period of time.    In order for the 3-step process to work correctly, you must closely follow KBS' instructions. You can view/download them here prior to receiving your order:"

And because KBS products have special formulations any off-the-shelf paint thinner may not give the expected results. The KBS #1 Thinner is especially formulated to thin their products. Regular solvents may contain moisture that can adversely affect the performance of their coatings. When in doubt, stick with what the manufacturer recommends.

Rust Seal is brushed, rolled, or sprayed on after treating the area with KBS Klean and RustBlast. Rust Seal hardens with exposure to atmospheric moisture - it gets harder and more durable when exposed to the atmosphere! It's extremely durable and very resistant to chips, scratches, cracks, or peeling which helps ensure the rusted area will never be re-exposed. It's also flexible so it bends with the surface. You can install it with a brush, roller, or with a spray gun (when properly diluted) and it's self-leveling. We use it on BMW subframe repairs, reinforcements, roll cage, and other chassis work. It's often used in restoration and hot rod shops as a frame coating. It's extremely tough and durable and can be painted with any top coat. Top coating is recommended as a finish because KBS Seal will change color after prolonged UV exposure (but its protective properties will not change). This is an excellent coating to use for E36 or E46 rear subframe reinforcements, coating and sealing subframes, sheetmetal, chassis reinforcements, roll cages, and so much more.   For the best adhesion, the surface    prepped with KBS Klean and RustBlast. These products will strip away contaminants, grease, and oils, as well as neutralize the rust and prepare the rusted areas for sealing. The KBS instructions are very clear and easy to follow. A handy 3-step sampler kit is available with enough RustSeal to cover 12sq ft (see below).   In order for the 3-step process to work correctly, you must closely follow KBS' instructions.

BlackTop is applied after treating the area with KBS Klean and RustBlast or can be applied directly over Rust Seal as a UV-stable topcoat. Just like Rust Seal, it hardens with exposure to atmospheric moisture - it gets harder and more durable when exposed to the atmosphere! It's extremely durable and very resistant to chips, scratches, cracks, or peeling which helps ensure the rusted area will never be re-exposed. It's also flexible so it bends with the surface.

For the best adhesion, the surface should be cleaned with KBS Klean. BlackTop works best over a surface that has been pre-sealed with KBS RustSeal. Apply a light self-etching primer and then apply BlackTop. The KBS instructions are very clear and easy to follow.   BlackTop is available as a clear topcoat called Diamond Finish (see below)."
