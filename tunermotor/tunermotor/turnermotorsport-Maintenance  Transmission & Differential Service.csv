Red Line thoroughly evaluates the manufacturer's recommendations and only makes a fluid recommendation if their own product meets or exceeds the original specification. In many cases the Red Line synthetic will outperform the factory supplied fluids. We've been using Red Line Oil in our BMWs since we opened in 1994 and it remains our best selling BMW differential fluid. 75/90 is the weight most commonly used in BMW differentials since the 1960s, including the factory clutch-type limited-slip diffs (exceptions being M3/M5/M6 cars since 2001). We use 75W90 in nearly all BMW chassis and the custom differentials that we sell. It's great for the street where the polyol-ester base has natural lubricity and friction modifiers lead to smoother and quieter operation with lower operating temps than the factory fluid. We also use it in some track cars that don't already use the more aggressive 75/90NS fluid (without friction modifiers).   Recommended or exceeds specifications for API GL-5, GL-6, MT-1, MIL-L-2105E, SAE J2360, and Chrysler spec MS-9763. Matches the specifications for the factory BMW SAF-XO diff fluid (#07512293972)."

This plastic pan will experience numerous drastic heat cycles over its lifetime, causing it to become weak and brittle, leading to potential catastrophic failure. Not only is this dangerous, but this is also very expensive when factoring in regular services. Upgrade your BMW's ZF transmission pan to PPE's Heavy-Duty Aluminum Transmission Pan and be done with pan replacements! PPE's one-of-a-kind transmission oil pan is cast from high-strength aluminum, allowing this pan to be used for the life of your transmission while also providing multiple benefits over your stock pan. Thanks to the thicker aluminum construction, internal heat fins, and integrated external cool fins, this pan helps promote reduced transmission fluid temperatures. PPE's trans pan has also been designed to allow for an additional quart of transmission fluid. The combined benefits of both cooler trans fluid and greater fluid capacity results in better lubrication, increased service life, and longer track sessions! That's not all! To top it all off, this pan also includes a high-powered Neodymium magnet built into the drain plug, preventing metal contaminants from being cycled through your transmission and causing damage. Replaces Genuine BMW part number: 24118612901 Need a replacement filter?

With BMW transmission life seemingly becoming shorter with each generation, we think it's just good-ole' common sense to replace the fluid at regular intervals (35-50,000 miles). Let's face it: transmission fluid at 50, 70, or 100,000 miles is not going to be as effective as when it left the factory. And if you drive your BMW like a driving machine and not like hearse, you'll want the extra protection that regular fluid changes offer.   In our TMS Service bays we use Red Line Synthetic Oils. Theyhave been enormously effective on the racetrack - helping us to win dozens of races and championships. And their track-record on the street is second-to-none.
