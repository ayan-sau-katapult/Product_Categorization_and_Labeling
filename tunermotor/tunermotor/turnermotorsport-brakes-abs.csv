Since the sensor is tied into the ABS and DSC systems a bad or non-functioning one can cause trouble throughout the car. The sensors are in a very vulnerable spot in the wheel hub - dirt, grease, and other particles can damage the sensor. You might get lucky and clean the sensor but on high mileage cars it might be best to just replace it. With no signal from the sensor the ABS and DSC will revert to a fail safe mode or not work at all and the lights on the instrument cluster will come on.

This is an OE or OEM Ate part direct from the manufacturer.   Since the sensor is tied into the ABS and DSC systems a bad or non-functioning one can cause trouble throughout the car. The sensors are in a very vulnerable spot in the wheel hub - dirt, grease, and other particles can damage the sensor. You might get lucky and clean the sensor but on high mileage cars it might be best to just replace it. With no signal from the sensor the ABS and DSC will revert to a fail safe mode or not work at all and the lights on the instrument cluster will come on. There should be a hard fault code and check engine light too and the code will tell you which ABS sensor needs replacing.   This is the rear sensor and fits either the left or right wheel hub.

The sensors are in a very vulnerable spot in the wheel hub - dirt, grease, and other particles can damage the sensor. You might get lucky and clean the sensor but on high mileage cars it might be best to just replace it. With no signal from the sensor the ABS and DSC will revert to a fail safe mode or not work at all and the lights on the instrument cluster will come on. There should be a hard fault code and check engine light too and the code will tell you which ABS sensor needs replacing.   This is the rear sensor and fits either the left or right wheel hub.
